FADE IN:
 
INT. KOROVA MILKBAR - NIGHT
Tables, chairs made of nude fibreglass figures.
Hypnotic atmosphere.
Alex, Pete, Georgie and Dim, teenagers stoned on their milk-plus, their 
feet resting on faces, crotches, lips of the sculptured furniture.

ALEX (V.O.)
There was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie 
and Dim and we sat in the Korova milkbar trying to make up our 
rassoodocks what to do with the evening. The Korova Milk Bar sold 
milkplus, milk plus vellocet or synthemesc or drencrom which is what we 
were drinking. This would sharpen you up and make you ready for a bit 
of the old ultra-violence. Our pockets were full of money so there was 
no need on that score, but, as they say, money isn't everything.
 
INT. PEDESTRIAN UNDERPASS TUNNEL - NIGHT
A Tramp lying in tunnel, singing.

TRAMP
In Dublin's fair city
Where the girls are so pretty
I first set my eyes on sweet Molly Malone
As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
Through streets wide and narrow...
Shadows of the boys approaching fall across Tramp.

TRAMP
Crying cockless and mussels alive,
Alive O...
Alive, alive O... Alive, alive O...
Crying cockless and mussels alive,
Alive O...

ALEX (V.O.)
One thing I could never stand is to see a filthy, dirty old drunkie, 
howling away at the filthy songs of his fathers and going blerp, blerp 
in between as it might be a filthy old orchestra in his stinking rotten 
guts. I could never stand to see anyone like that, whatever his age 
might be, but more especially when he was real old like this one was.
The boys stop and applaud him.

TRAMP
Can you... can you spare some cutter, me brothers?
Alex rams his stick into the Tramp's stomach. The boys laugh.

TRAMP
Oh-hhh!!! Go on, do me in you bastard cowards. I don't want to live 
anyway, not in a stinking world like this.

ALEX
Oh - and what's so stinking about it?

TRAMP
It's a stinking world because there's no law and order any more. It's a 
stinking world because it lets the young get onto the old like you 
done. It's no world for an old man any more. What sort of a world is it 
at all? Men on the moon and men spinning around the earth and there's 
not no attention paid to earthly law and order no more.
The Tramp starts singing again.

TRAMP
Oh dear land, I fought for thee and brought you peace and victory.
Alex and gang move in and start beating up on old Tramp.
 
INT. DERELICT CASINO - NIGHT
Billyboy gang on stage tearing clothes off a screaming Girl.

ALEX (V.O.)
It was around by the derelict casino that we came across Billyboy and 
his four droogs. They were getting ready to perform a little of the old 
in-out, in-out on a weepy young devotchka they had there.
Alex and gang step out of the shadows.

ALEX
Ho, Ho, Ho... Well, if it isn't stinking Billygoat Billyboy in poison. 
How are thou, thou globby bottle of cheap stinking chip oil? Come and 
get one in the yarbles, if you have any yarbles, you eunuch jelly thou.
Billyboy snaps open a switchblade knife.

BILLY BOY
Let's get 'em boys.
The fight begins, chains, knives, kicking boots. Police siren.

ALEX
The Police... come on, let's go... come on.
Alex and the boys rush out of casino.
 
EXT. / INT. CAR - NIGHT - FAST DRIVING SHOTS
Swerving car, forcing other cars off the road, trying to hit 
pedestrians, etc.

ALEX (V.O.)
The Durango-95 purred away real horrorshow - a nice, warm vibraty 
feeling all through your guttiwuts. Soon it was trees and dark, my 
brothers, with real country dark. We fillied around for a while with 
other travelers of the night, playing hogs of the road. Then we headed 
west, what we were after now was the old surprise visit, that was a 
real kick and good for laughs and lashing of the ultra-violent.
 
EXT. "HOME" - NIGHT
A cottage on its own, on outskirts of a village.
Bright moonlight. Cheery light inside.
Car pulls to stop.
Alex shushes his giggling boys and gets out of the car.
 
INT. "HOME" - NIGHT
Mr. Alexander typing. Bell rings.

MR. ALEXANDER
Who on earth could that be?

MRS. ALEXANDER
I'll see.
Mrs. Alexander, a good-looking red head in a red jumper suit.

MRS. ALEXANDER
Yes? Who is it?

ALEX
Excuse me, Mrs... will you please help, there's been a terrible 
accident.
She opens the door on the chain and peeps out.

ALEX
My friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death. Could I 
please use your telephone for an ambulance?

MRS. ALEXANDER
I'm sorry, but we don't have a telephone. You'll have to go somewhere 
else.

ALEX
But Mrs... it's a matter of life and death.
From inside the sound of clack clacky clack clack clackity clackclack 
of Alexander typing stops.

MR. ALEXANDER
Who is it, dear?

MRS. ALEXANDER
There's a young man here. He says there's been an accident. He wants to 
use the telephone.

MR. ALEXANDER
Then you'd better let him in.

MRS. ALEXANDER
Wait a minute.

ALEX
Thank you, Mrs.
Mrs. Alexander opens door, saying...

MRS. ALEXANDER
I'm sorry, we don't usually let people in the middle of the night.
Alex and boys have put on their masks and rush into house, carrying and 
dragging Mrs. Alexander along with them.
 
INT. HOME - NIGHT
They go roaring in.
Mr. Alexander is kicked in the face and goes down. Georgie leaps on 
him. Pete jumps up and down and the settee. Dim grabs hold of Mrs. 
Alexander. Alex whistles piercingly.

ALEX
Right, Pete. Check the rest of the house.
Alex turns to Dim who holds the struggling Mrs. Alexander.

ALEX
Dim...
Dim sets her down but holds her firmly. Alex starts to sing - "Singin' 
in the Rain", accompanying it with a kind of tap dance.

ALEX
(singing)
I'm singing in the rain...
He kicks Mr. Alexander accenting the lyrics.

ALEX
(singing)
Just singing in the rain...
He clubs Mr. Alexander with stick, in the time to the music.

ALEX
(singing)
What a glorious feeling, I'm happy again.
He pushes a rubber ball into Mrs. Alexander's mouth and binds it with 
sellotape.

ALEX
(singing)
I'm laughing at clouds so dark up above.
The sun's in my heart and I'm ready for love.
Let the stormy clouds chase...
He kicks Mr. Alexander again.

ALEX
(singing)
... everyone from the place.
Come on with the rain...
He puts ball in Mr. Alexander's mouth and sellotapes it.

ALEX
(singing)
... I've a smile on my face.
I'll walk down the lane... to a happy refrain.
I'm singing... just singin' in the rain.
He knocks down the book cases and moves to Mrs. Alexander being held by 
Dim. Starts to repeat on song as he cuts slowly up each leg of her cat 
suit, until she is naked. This coincidences with the song finishing.
He turns to Mr. Alexander.

ALEX
Viddy well, my little Brother. Viddy well.
 
INT. KOROVA MILKBAR - NIGHT
The boys enter yawning..

ALEX (V.O.)
We were all feeling a bit shagged and fagged and fashed, it having been 
an evening of some small energy expenditure, O my brothers, so we got 
rid of the auto and stopped off at the Korova for a nightcap.
Dim moves over to milk machine and speaks to the statue of the nude 
girl.

DIM
Hello Lucy, had a busy night?
Puts money in machine.

DIM
We've been working hard too.
Takes glass.

DIM
Pardon me. Luce.
He raises glass to breast, pulls red handle between her legs. Milk 
spurts into glass.
Dim joins the others. Alex looks at a party of tourists.

ALEX (V.O.)
There was some sophistos from the TV studios around the corner, 
laughing an govoreeting. The Devotchka was smecking away, and not 
caring about the wicked world one bit. Then the disc on the stereo 
twanged off and out, and in the short silence before the next one came 
on, she suddenly came with a burst of singing, and it was like for a 
moment, O my brothers, some great bird had flown into the milkbar and I 
felt all the malenky little hairs on my plott standing endwise, athe 
shivers crawling up like slow malenky lizards and then down again. 
Because I knew what she sang. It was a bit from the glorious 9th, by 
Ludwig van.
Dim makes a lip-trump followed by a dog howl, followed by two fingers 
pronging twice in the air, followed by a clowny guffaw.
Alex brings his stick down smartly on Dim's legs.

DIM
What did you do that for?

ALEX
For being a bastard with no manners and not a dook of an idea how to 
comport yourself publicwise, O my Brother.

DIM
I don't like you should do what you done. And I'm not your brother no 
more and wouldn't want to be.

ALEX
Watch that... Do watch that, O Dim, if to continue to be on live thou 
dost wish.

DIM
Yarbles, great bolshy yarblockos to you I'll meet you with chain, or 
nozh or britva, any time, not having you aiming tolchocks at me 
reasonless. It stands to reason, I won't have it.

ALEX
A nozh scrap any time you say.
Dim weakens.

DIM
Doobidoob... a bit tired maybe, everybody is. A long night for growing 
malchicks... best not to say more. Bedways is rigthways now, so best we 
go homeways and get a bit of spatchka. Right, right.
 
INT. ALEX'S FLATBLOCK - MAIN LOBBY ENTRANCE - NIGHT
Alex passes a mural in the hall. Nude men and women. Their massive 
stylised bodies embellished and decorated by handy pencil and 
ballpoint.
The elevator door is buckled.
 
INT. ALEX'S FLAT - NIGHT
Alex pees in toilet.
Alex goes into his room. Tosses his loot into a drawer, full of money, 
wristwatches, cameras, etc.
Fifty small loudspeakers cover one wall.
He puts his pet boa constrictor on tree branch mounted on the wall, 
above four Christ figures who have their arms intertwined like a chorus 
line.
He puts a cassette into the tape player.
A heavy shockwave of sound - Beethoven's 9th.

ALEX (V.O.)
It had been a wonderful evening and what I needed now to give it the 
perfect ending was a bit of the old Ludwig van.
Music starts.

ALEX (V.O.)
Then, brothers, it came. O bliss, bliss and heaven, oh it was 
gorgeousness and georgeosity made flesh. The trombones crunched redgold 
under my bed, and behind my gulliver the trumpets three-wise, silver-
flamed and there by the door the timps rolling through my guts and out 
again, crunched like candy thunder. It was like a bird of rarest spun 
heaven metal or like silvery wine flowing in a space ship, gravity all 
nonsense now. As I slooshied, I knew such lovely pictures. There were 
veeks and ptitsas laying on the ground screaming for mercy and I was 
smecking all over my rot and grinding my boot into their tortured 
litsos and there were naked devotchkas ripped and creeching against 
walls and I plunging like a shlaga into them.
 
INT. ALEX'S FLAT - DAY
He is asleep. The boa curled up at his feet. There is a knock on the 
door.

ALEX
What d'you want?

EM
It's past eight, Alex, you don't want to be late for school, son.

ALEX
Bit of pain in the gulliver, Mum. Leave us be and I'll try to sleep it 
off... then I'll be as right as dodgers for this after.

EM
You've not been to school all week, son.

ALEX
I've got to rest, Mum... got to get fit, otherwise I'm liable to miss a 
lot more school.

EM
Eeee... I'll put your breakfast in the oven. I've got to be off myself 
now.

ALEX
Alright, Mum... have a nice day at the factory.
 
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Pee sitting at breakfast table.
Em enters.

EM
He's not feeling too good again this morning, Dad.

PEE
Yes, I heard. D'you know what time he got in last night?

EM
No I don't know, luv, I'd taken my sleepers.

PEE
I wonder where exactly is it he goes to work of evenings.

EM
Well, like he says, it's mostly odd things he does, helping like... 
here and there, as it might be.
 
INT. EM'S BEDROOM - DAY
Alex comes out of his room and finds P.R. Deltoid sitting on bed in 
parent's room.

ALEX
Hi, hi, hi there, Mr. Deltoid, funny surprise to see you here.

DELTOID
Ah, Alex boy, awake at last, yes? I met your mother on the way to work, 
yes? She gave me the key. She said something about a pain somewhere... 
hence not at school , yes?

ALEX
A rather intolerable pain in the head, brother, sir. I think it should 
be clear by this afterlunch.

DELTOID
Oh, or certainly by this evening, yes? The evening's a great time, 
isn't it, Alex boy?

ALEX
A cup of the old chai, sir?

DELTOID
No time, no time, yes. Sit, sit, sit.
Alex sits next to him.

ALEX
To what do I owe this extreme pleasure, sir? Anything wrong, sir?
Deltoid "playfully" grabs Alex's hair.

DELTOID
Wrong? Why should you think of anything being wrong, have you been 
doing something you shouldn't. Yes?
He shakes Alex's hair.

ALEX
Just a manner of speech, sir.

DELTOID
Well, yes, it's just a manner of speech from your Post Corrective 
Advisor to you that you watch out, little Alex.
He puts his arm round Alex's shoulder.

DELTOID
Because next time it's going to be the barry place and all my work 
ruined. If you've no respect for your horrible self, you at least might 
have some for me who'se sweated over you.
He slaps Alex on the knee.

DELTOID
A big black mark I tell you for every one we don't reclaim. A 
confession of failure for every one of you who ends up in the stripy 
hole.

ALEX
I've been doing nothing I shouldn't, sir. The millicents have nothing 
on me, brother, sir, I mean.
Deltoid pulls Alex down on the bed.

DELTOID
Cut out all this clever talk about milicents. Just because the Police 
haven't picked you up lately doesn't, as you very well know, mean that 
you've not been up to some nastiness. There was a bit of a nastiness 
last night, yes. Some very extreme nastiness, yes. A few of a certain 
Billyboy's friends were ambluenced off late last night, yes. Your name 
was mentioned, the word's got thru to me by the usual channels. Certain 
friends of yours were named also. Oh, nobody can prove anything about 
anybody as usual, but I'm warning you, little Alex, being a good friend 
to you as always, the one man in this sore and sick community who wants 
to save you from yourself. 
Deltoid makes a grab for Alex's joint but finds his hand instead. Alex 
laughs. Derisively and rises. Deltoid distractedly reaches for a glass 
of water on the night table, and fails to notice a set of false teeth 
soaking in them. He drinks from the glass. The clink of the teeth 
sounding like ice-cubes.

DELTOID
What gets into you all? We study the problem. We've been studying it 
for damn well near a century, yes, but we get no further with our 
studies. You've got a good home here, good loving parents, you've got 
not too bad of a brain. Is it some devil that crawls inside of you?

ALEX
Nobody's got anything on me, brother, sir. I've been out of the rookers 
of the milicents for a long time now.

DELTOID
That's just worries me. A bit too long to long to be reasonable. You're 
about due now by my reckoning, that's why I'm warning you, little Alex, 
to keep your handsome young proboscis out of the dirt. Do I make myself 
clear?

ALEX
As an unmuddied lake, sir. Clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. You 
can rely on me, sir.
Deltoid drinks again but this time sees the teeth in the glass. He 
groans and retches.
 
INT. MUSIC BOOTICK - DAY
Alex enters. Two pretty micro-boppers, Marty and Sonietta, sucking 
phallic ice sticks.

ALEX
Pardon me, brother. I ordered this two weeks ago. Could you see if it's 
arrived.

CLERK
OK. I'll see if it's in.
Clerk exits. Alex turns to the girls.

ALEX
Pardon me, ladies
He steps in between them and goes through the motions, looking through.

ALEX
Enjoying it then, my darling?... A bit cold and pointless isn't it, my 
lovely... What's happened to yours, my little sister?
Marty giggles.

MARTY
Who you getten bratty, Goggly Gogol? Johnny Zhivago? The Heaven 
Seventeen?

ALEX
What you got back home, little sister, to play your fuzzy warbles on? I 
bet you got little save pitiful portable picnic players. Come with 
Uncle and hear all proper. Hear angel trumpets and devil trombones. You 
are invited.
 
INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY
The two girls, naked, jumping up and down on Alex's still unmade bed 
zonked by the booming, all engulfing sound of Alex's incredible Hi-Fi.
 
INT. ALEX'S FLATBLOCK - LOBBY HALL - DAY
Alex finds the gang waiting for him.

ALEX
Hi, hi, hi, there

ALL THREE
Well, .

DIM
He are here! He have arrived! Hooray!

ALEX
Welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, welly, well. To what do I owe the 
extreme pleasure of this surprising visit?
Georgie rises.

GEORGIE
We got worried. There we were waiting and drinking away at the old 
knify Moloko and you had not turned up and we thought you might have 
been like offended by something or other, so around we come to your 
abode.

ALEX
Appy polly loggies. I had something of a pain in the gulliver so had to 
sleep. I was not awakened when I gave orders for awakening.

DIM
Sorry about the pain. Using the gulliver to much like, eh? Giving 
orders and disciplining and that perhaps, eh? You sure the pain's gone? 
You sure you'll not be happier back up in bed.

ALEX
Lets get things nice and sparkling clear. This sarcasm, if I may call 
it such, does not become you, O my brothers. As I am your droog and 
leader, I am entitled to know what goes on, eh? Now then, Dim, what 
does that great big horsy gape of a grin portend?

GEORGIE
All right, no more picking on Dim, brother. That's part of the new way.

ALEX
New way? What's this about a new way? There's been some very large talk 
behind my sleeping back, and no error. Let me hear more.

GEORGIE
Well, we go round shop crasting and the like, coming out with a pitiful 
rookerful of money each.

DIM
Pitiful rookerful...

GEORGIE
And there's Will the English in the Muscleman coffee mesto saying he 
can fence anything that anything that any malchick tries to crast.

DIM
Yeah... Pete the English.

GEORGIE
The shiny stuff. The Ice. The big, big, big money is available's what 
Will the English says.

DIM
Big, big money.

ALEX
And what will you do with the big, big, money? Have you not everything 
you need? If you need a motor-car, you pluck it from the trees. If you 
need pretty polly, you take it.

GEORGIE
Brother, you think and talk sometimes like a little child. Tonight we 
pull a mansize crast.

ALEX
Good. Real horrorshow. Initiative comes to them as waits. I've taught 
you much, my little droogies. Now tell me what you have in mind, 
Georgie Boy.

GEORGIE
Oh, the old moloko-plus first, would you not say

DIM
Moloko-plus.

GEORGIE
Something to sharpen us up, you especially. We have the start.
 
EXT. FLATBLOCK MARINE - DAY
The gang come out of the flatblock and walk along the marina.

ALEX (V.O.)
As we walked along the flatblock marina, I was calm on the outside but 
thinking all the time, so now it was to be Georgie the General, saying 
what we should do and what not to do, and Dim as his mindless, grinning 
bulldog. But, suddenly, I viddied that thinking was for the gloopy ones 
and that the oomny ones use like inspiration and what Bog sends, for 
now it was lovely music that came to my aid and I viddied at once what 
to do. There was a window open with the stereo on.
 
IN SLOW MOTION
Alex clubs Georgie into water with his stick. Dim swings chain. Alex 
ducks. Dim goes into water.
Alex kneels, hands behind back, takes knife from sword stick, offers 
hand to help Dim, and slashes Dim when he gets it.
Dim falls back into the water.
Alex laughs.
 
INT. DUKE OF NEW YORK PUB
The four boys sit round table.

ALEX (V.O.)
I had not put into any of Dim's main cables and so, with the help of a 
clean tashtook, the red, red kroovy stopped, and it did not take long 
to quieten the two wounded soldiers, down in the snug in the Duke of 
New York. Now they knew who was Master and Leader. Sheep, thought I, 
but a real leader knows always when like to give and show generous to 
his unders.

ALEX
Well, now we're back to where we were. Yes? Just like before and all 
forgotten? Right, right, right.

ALL BOYS
Right. Right. Right.

ALEX
Well, Georgie Boy. This idea you've got for tonight. Well, tell us all 
about it then.

GEORGIE
Not tonight - not this nochy.

ALEX
Come, come, come, Georgie Boy. You're a big strong chelloveck like us 
all. We're not little children, are we, Georgie Boy? What, then, didst 
thou in thy mind have?
Confrontation. Georgie backs down.

GEORGIE
It's this Health Farm. A bit out of the town. Isolated. It's owned by 
this like very rich ptitsa who lives there with her cats. The place is 
shut down for a week and she's completely on her own, and it's full up 
with like gold and silver and like jewels.

ALEX
Tell me more, Georgie Boy.
 
INT. CATLADY'S HOUSE
Catlady doing yoga exercises.
Room is full of cats. Doorbell rings.

CATLADY
(softly to herself)
Oh shit.
She goes to the door.
 
EXT. CATLADY'S HOUSE

CATLADY
Who's there?

ALEX
Excuse me, missus, can you please help? There's been a terrible 
accident. Can I please use your telephone for an ambulance?

CATLADY
I'm frightfully sorry. There is a telephone in the Public House about a 
mile down the road. I suggest you use that.

ALEX
But, missus, this is an emergency. It's a matter of life and death. Me 
friend's lying in the middle of the road bleeding to death.

CATLADY
I... I'm very sorry, but I never open. I'm very sorry but I never open 
the door to strangers after dark.

ALEX
Very well, madam. I suppose you can't be blamed for being suspicious 
with so many scoundrels and rouges of the night about.
Alex walks away from door, then ducks into the bushes where the others 
are hiding. They put on their maskies and follow Alex round to the rear 
of the house.

ALEX
Dim, bend down.
(Alex points to an upstairs window)
I'm gonna get in that window and open the front door.
He climbs up drain-pipe to the bathroom window.
 
INT. CADLADY'S HOUSE
The Catlady enters and dials a number.

CATLADY
Hullo, Radlett Police Station. Good evening. It's Miss Weathers at 
Woodmere Health Farm. Look, I'm frightfully sorry to bother you but 
something rather odd has just happened... Well, it's probably nothing 
at all, but you never know... Well, a young man rang the bell asking to 
use the telephone... He said there had been some kind of accident. The 
thing that caught my attention was what he said - the words he used, 
sounded exactly like what was quoted in the papers this morning in 
connection with the writer and his wife who were assaulted last 
night... Well, just a few minutes ago... Well, if you think that's 
necessary, but, well, I'm quite sure he's gone away now. Oh... alright. 
Fine. Thank you very much. Thank you.
She puts phone down, turns and nearly jumps out of her leotard when she 
sees Alex in the doorway.

ALEX
Hi, hi, hi there, at last we meet.

CATLADY
What the bloody hell d'you think you're doing?

ALEX
Our brief govereet thru the letter hole was not, shall we say, 
satisfactory, yes?

CATLADY
Now listen here, you little bastard, just you turn around and walk out 
of here the same way as you came in.
Alex eyes a giant white, fibreglass phallic sculpture on the table 
beside him.

ALEX
Naughty, naughty, naughty, you filthy old soomaka.

CATLADY
No! No! Don't touch it. That's a very important work of art. What the 
bloody hell do you want?

ALEX
You see, madam, I am part of an international student's contest to see 
who can get the most points for selling magazines.

CATLADY
Cut the shit, sonny, and get out of here before you get yourself in 
some very serious trouble.
He rocks the giant phallus which has a special weight swinging inside 
causing it to swing up and down an eccentric motion.

CATLADY
I told you to leave it alone. Now get out of here before I throw you 
out, wretched slummy bedbug. I'll teach you breaking into real people's 
houses. Get out!
She grabs up a bust of Beethoven and rushes at Alex. He grabs the giant 
phallic sculpture.
Circling, Alex fends off her mad rushes with skilful jabs of the giant 
phallus.
She ducks under and clobbers him with the heavy bust of Beethoven.
He goes down, pulling her off balance and they both wind up the floor.
In the struggle, Alex bashes her with the phallus.
Distant Police sirens.
He exits.
 
EXT. CATLDAY'S HOUSE - NIGHT
Alex rushes out. Dim and the others are waiting.

ALEX
Come on. Let's go, the police are coming.

DIM
One minoota, droogie.
Dim smashes Alex in the face with a full milk bottle. He goes down. The 
others run away, laughing.

ALEX
(screaming)
You bastards... bastards.
 
INT. POLICE HQ - NIGHT
Inspector takes out cigarette and lights up.

INSPECT
Right. Right , Tom, we'll have to our little friend, Alex, here that we 
know the law, too, but that knowing the law isn't everything. 
He nods to Fatneck.

FATNECK
That's a nasty cut you've got there, little Alex. Spoils... all your 
beauty. Who gave you that then... eh... eh...
He presses Alex's nose, inflicting great pain. Alex sinks to his knees.

ALEX
Ow... what's that for, you bastard?

FATNECK
That was for your lady victim. You ghastly wretched scoundrel.
Alex grabs his balls.
Alex is beaten by the other Cop.
Inspector exits to outside office where Sergeant sits, sipping a cup of 
tea.
Deltoid has just entered.

INSPECTOR
Sergeant.

SERGEANT
Sir.

INSPECTOR
Ah, good evening, Mr. Deltoid.

DELTOID
Evening, Inspector.

SERGEANT
Would you like your tea now, sir?

INSPECTOR
No, thank you, Sergeant. We'll have it later. May I have some paper 
towels, please.

SERGEANT
Yes, sir.

INSPECTOR
We're interrogating the prisoner now. Perhaps you'd care to come 
inside.

DELTOID
Thank you very much
They move into Interrogation Room.
Alex is on the floor in the corner covered with blood.

DELTOID
Evening, Sergeant. Evening, all. Dear, dear, this boy does look a mess, 
doesn't he? Just look at the state of him.

FATNECK
Love's young nightmare like.

INSPECTOR
Violence makes violence. He resisted his lawful arrestors.

DELTOID
Well, it's happened, Alex boy, yes. Just as I thought it would, yes. 
Dear, dear, dear. Well, this is the end of the line for me... the end 
of the line, yes.

ALEX
It wasn't me, brother, sir. Speak up for me, sir, for I'm not so bad. I 
was led on by the treachery of others, sir.

INSPECTOR
Sings the roof off lovely, he does that.

ALEX
And where are my stinking traitorous droogs. Get them before the get 
away. It was all their idea, brothers. They forced me to do it. I'm 
innocent.

DELTOID
You are now a murderer, little Alex. A murderer, yes.

ALEX
Not true, sir. It was only a slight tolchock. She was breathing, I 
swear it.

DELTOID
I've just come back from the hospital. Your victim has died.

ALEX
You try to frighten me, sir, admit so, sir. This is some new form of 
torture. Say it, brother, sir.

DELTOID
It will be your own torture. I hope to God it will torture you to 
madness.

FATNECK
If you'd care to give him a bash in the chops, sir. Don't mind us. 
We'll hold him down. He must be a great disappointment to you, sir.
Deltoid spits in Alex's face.
 
HELICOPTER VIEWS OF PRISON

ALEX (V.O.)
This is the real weepy and like tragic part of the story beginning, O 
my brothers and only friends. After a trial with judges and a jury, and 
some very hard words spoken against your friend and humble narrator, he 
was sentenced to 14 years in Staja No. 84F among smelly perverts and 
hardened prestoopnicks, the shock sending my dadda beating his bruised 
and kroovy rookas against unfair Bog in his Heaven, and my mom, 
boohoohooing in her mother's grief as her only child and son of her 
bosom, like letting everybody down real horrorshow.
 
INT. PRISON CHECK-IN ROOM - DAY
A bell rings and a Warder goes and unlocks first a wooden door and then 
a barred door.

CHIEF GUARD
Then your toes belong on the other side of it!!!

ALEX
Yes sir.

CHIEF GUARD

Alex tosses a bar of chocolate on the desk.

CHIEF GUARD 
Pick that up and put it down properly.
Alex does so, and continues to empty his pockets.

CHIEF GUARD 
One half bar of chocolate. One bunch of keys on white metal ring. One 
packet of cigarettes. Two plastic ball pens - one black, one red. One 
pocket comb - black plastic. One address book - imitation red leather.

CHIEF GUARD 
Right. Sign here for your valuable property.
Alex signs.

CHIEF GUARD
The chocolate and cigarettes you brought in - you lose that as you are 
now convicted. Now go over to the table and get undressed.

INT. PRISON CHAPEL - DAY
Priest in pulpit big rough state-proper type.
Convict audience.
Alex sits apart tending an overhead projector.

PRIEST
I ask you friends. What's it going to be then? Is it going to be in and 
out of institutions like this? Or more in then out for most of you? Or 
are you going to attend the divine word and realise the punishment that 
awaits unrepentant sinners in the next world as well as this. A lot of 
Idiots you are, selling your birthright for a saucer of cold porridge. 
The urge to live easy. I ask you friends, is it worth it? When we have 
undeniable proof - yes, my friends, incontrovertible evidence that Hell 
exists. I know, I know, my friends. I have been informed in visions 
that there is a place darker than any prison, hotter than any human 
flame of fire, where unrepentant criminals, sinners like yourselves...
A convict burps.
All laugh.

PRIEST
Don't you laugh, damn you, don't you laugh. I say like yourselves - 
scream in endless and unendurable agony. Their nostrils choked with the 
smell of filth, their mouths crammed with burning ordure. Their skins 
rotting and peeling. A fireball spinning in their screaming guts. I 
know... oh yes, I know.
A convict lets rip some lip music - prrrrrrrp. There is laughter. Chief 
Guard moves forward - points. 

CHIEF GUARD
I saw you, 920537. I saw you.

CONVICT
Up yours, mate.

CHIEF GUARD
Just you wait, 744678. One on the turnip coming up for you.

PRIEST
Quiet, my friends. Quiet. Quiet, I say. We will now sing Hymn 2in the 
Prisoner's Hymnal.
Piano starts up and Alex starts up overhead projector which displays 
the words of the hymn.

CHIEF GUARD
Show a little reverence, you bastards. Quiet!
Convicts and all start to sing.

SINGING
I was a wandering sheep.
I did not love...

CHIEF GUARD
Sing up damn you. Louder, sing up.

SINGING
... the fold
I did not love my shepherd's voice.
I would not be controlled.

CHIEF GUARD
Come on, sing up, damn you.

SINGING
I was a wayward child
I did not love my home
I did not love my father's voice
I loved afar to roam.

ALEX (V.O.)
It had not been edifying, indeed not, being in this hell hole and human 
zoo for two years now, being kicked and tolchocked by brutal warders, 
and meeting leering criminals and perverts ready to dribble all over a 
lucious young malchick like your story-teller. 
 
INT. PRIEST'S LIBRARY - DAY
Alex reading the Bible.

ALEX (V.O.)
It was my rabbit to help the prison charlie with the Sunday service. He 
was a bolshy great burly bastard, but he was very fond of myself, me 
being very young, and also now very interested in the big book.
Priest walks by and nods pleasantly.

ALEX (V.O.)
It had been arranged by the prison charlie, as part of my further 
education to read him the Bible. I didn't so much like the latter part 
of the book which is more like all preachy talking, than fighting and 
the old in-out. I liked the parts where these old yahoodies tolchock 
each other and then drink their Hebrew vino and, then getting on to the 
bed with their wives' handmaidens. That kept me going.
 
BIBLE FANTASY - FIGHTING - DAY
Biblical fighting shot. Alex slashing away. Blood spurting.
 
HANDMAIDEN FANTASY IN TENT - DAY
Alex lying with three semi-nude handmaidens.
 
EXT. BIBLICAL STREET
Christ being whipped on by Alex, dressed as a Legionary.

ALEX
Move on there. Move on.

ALEX (V.O.)
I read all about the scourging and the crowning with thorns and all 
that, and I could viddy myself helping in and even taking charge of the 
tolchocking and the nailing in, being dressed in the height of Roman 
fashion.
 
BACK TO THE LIBRARY
Alex sits with his eyes closed.
Priest comes over and squeezes his shoulder.
Alex looks up at him and smiles.

PRIEST
(reading from Alex's Bible)
Seek not to be like evil men, neither desire to be with them, because 
their minds studieth robberies and their lips speak deceits.

ALEX
If thou lose hope being weary in the days of distress, thy strength 
shall be diminished.

PRIEST
Fine, my boy, fine, fine.

ALEX
Father, I have tried, have I not?

PRIEST
You have, my son.

ALEX
I've done my best, have I not?

PRIEST
Indeed.

ALEX
And, Father, I've never been guilty of any institutional infractions, 
have I?

PRIEST
You certainly have not, 655321. You've been very helpful, and you've 
shown a genuine desire to reform.

ALEX
Father - may I ask you a question in private?

PRIEST
Certainly, my son, certainly. Is there something troubling you, my son? 
Don't be shy to speak up. Remember, I know all the urges that can 
trouble young men deprived of the society of women.

ALEX
No Father. It's nothing like that, Father. It's about this new thing 
they're all talking about. About this new treatment that you out of 
prison in no time at all and makes sure you never get back in again.

PRIEST
Where did you hear about this? Whose been talking about these things?

ALEX
These things get around, Father. Two Warders talk as it might be, and 
somebody can't help overhearing what they say. Then somebody picks up a 
scrap of newspaper in the workshops and the newspaper tells all about 
it. How about putting me in for this new treatment, Father?

PRIEST
I take it you are referring to the Ludovico Technique?

ALEX
I don't know what it's called, Father, all I know is that it gets you 
out quickly and makes sure that you never get in again.

PRIEST
That's not proven, 655321. In fact, it is only in the experimental 
stage at this moment.

ALEX
But it is being used, isn't it, Father?

PRIEST
It has not been used yet in this prison. The Governor has grave doubts 
about it and I have heard that there are very serious dangers involved.

ALEX
I don't care about the danger, Father. I just want to be good. I want 
for the rest of my life to be one act of goodness.

PRIEST
The question is weather or not this technique really makes a man good. 
Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen. When a man cannot 
chose, he ceases to be a man.

ALEX
I don't understand about the whys and wherefores, Father. I only know I 
want to be good.

PRIEST
Be patient, my son, and put your trust in the Lord.

ALEX
Instruct thy son and he shall refresh thee and shall give delight to 
thy soul.

PRIEST
Amen.
They cross themselves.
 
EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY
Prisoners walking in circles.
 
INT. PRISON CORRIDOR
Guards stand either side of cell doors.
Chief Guard with Governor, Minister and entourage.

CHIEF GUARD
Mister.

GUARD
All present and correct, sir.

CHIEF GUARD
Right. All present and correct, sir.

GOVERNOR
Very good, Chief.
They inspect cells.

CHIEF GUARD
Leave to carry on, sir, please?

GOVERNOR
Carry on, Chief.

CHIEF GUARD
Sir.
 
EXT. PRISON YARD
Chief Guard comes out of door.

CHIEF GUARD
Right, pay attention. I want you in two lines. Up against that wall 
facing this way. Go on move! Hurry up about it and stop talking.
The men line up. Chief Guard moves back to door and comes to attention.

CHIEF GUARD
Ready for inspection, sir.
He stands back and salutes as Governor, Minister and entourage enter 
and walk along line of men.

MINISTER
How many to a cell?

GOVERNOR
Four in this block, sir.

MINISTER
Cram criminals together and what do you get - concentrated 
criminality... crime in the midst of punishment.

GOVERNOR
I agree, sir. What we need are larger prisons. More money.

MINISTER
Not a chance, my dear fellow. The Ggovernment can't be concerned any 
longer with outmoded penological theories. Soon we may be needing all 
of out prison space for political offenders. Common criminals like 
these are best dealt with on a purely curative basis. Kill the criminal 
reflex that's all. Full implementation in a year's time. Punishment 
means nothing to them, you can see that... they enjoy their so-called 
punishment.
Alex seizes his chance as they pass by.

ALEX
You're absolutely right, sir.

CHIEF GUARD
Shut your bleedin' hole!!!

MINISTER 
Who said that?

ALEX
I did, sir.

MINISTER
What crime did you commit.

ALEX
The accidental killing of a person, sir.

CHIEF GUARD
He brutally murdered a woman, sir, in furtherence of theft. 14 years... 
sir!

MINISTER
Excellent. He's enterprising, aggressive, outgoing. Young. Bold. 
Viscous. He'll do.

GOVERNOR
Well, fine... we could still look at C-Block.

MINISTER
No, no, no. That's enough. He's perfect. I want his records sent to me. 
This vicious young hoodlum will be transformed out of all recognition.

ALEX
Thank you very much for this chance, sir.

MINISTER
Let's hope you make the most of it, my boy.

GOVERNOR
Shall we go to my office?

MINISTER
Thank you.
 
INT. GOVERNOR'S OFFICE - DAY
Governor seated at his desk. There is a knock on the door.

GOVERNOR
Come in.
Door opens. Chief Guard enters with Alex.

CHIEF GUARD
Sir, 655321, sir.

GOVERNOR
Very good, Chief.
Chief Guard turns to Alex.

CHIEF GUARD
Forward to the white line, toes behind it. Full name and number to the 
Governor.
Chief Guard closes door.

ALEX
Alexander de Large, sir. 655321, sir.
The Governor takes off his glasses.

GOVERNOR
I don't suppose you know who that was this morning, do you? That was no 
less a personage than the Minister of the Interior and what they call a 
very new broom. Well, these new ridiculous ideas have come at last, and 
orders are orders, though I may say to you in confidence that I do not 
approve. An eye for an eye, I say, if someone hits you, you hit back, 
do you not? Why then should not the State very severely hit by you 
brutal offenders not hit back also? But the new view is to say no. The 
new view is that we turn the bad into good. All of which seems to be 
grossly unjust. Hmmmmmm.

ALEX
Sir...

CHIEF GUARD
Shut your filthy hole, you scum!!!

GOVERNOR
You are to be reformed. Tomorrow you go to this man, Brodsky. You wbe 
leaving here. You will be transferred to the Ludovico Medical Facility. 
It is believed that you will be able to leave State custody in a little 
over a fortnight. I suppose that prospect pleases you?

CHIEF GUARD
Answer when the Governor asks you a question you filthy young swine!

ALEX
Oh yes, sir. Thank you very much, sir. I've done my best here I really 
have, sir. I'm very grateful to all concerned.

GOVERNOR
Sign this - where it's marked.
Alex turns the paper to read it.

CHIEF GUARD
Don't read it - sign it!

GOVERNOR
It says that you are willing to have the residue of your sentence 
commuted to the Ludovico treatment.
Alex signs. Governor gathers up papers.
Alex dots the last "i" and smiles.
 
INT. LUDOVICO CENTRE RECEPTION DESK - DAY

ALEX (V.O.)
The next morning I was taken to the Ludovico Medical Facility, outside 
the town centre, and I felt a malenky bit sad having to say goodbye to 
the old Staja, as you always will when you leave a place you've like 
gotten used to.
Chief Guard briskly leads the way for Alex and escort. They move into 
reception hall where the Doctor stands.

CHIEF GUARD
(shouting like an RSM)
Right. Halt the prisoner. Good morning, sir, I'm Chief Officer Barnes. 
I've got 655321 on a transfer from Parkmoor to the Ludovico Centre, 
sir!

DOCTOR
Good morning, we've been expecting you. I'm Dr. Alcott.
Chief Guard checks the name from his clipboard.

CHIEF GUARD
Yes, Dr. Alcott. Are you prepared to accept the prisoner, sir?
 

DOCTOR
Yes, of course.

CHIEF GUARD
Well, I wonder if you'd mind signing these transfer documents, sir.
Doctor signs.

CHIEF GUARD
Thank you, sir. There, sir... there, and there, sir... and there. Thank 
you, sir. Prison escort move forward. Halt. Excuse me, sir. Is that the 
officer that is to take charge of the prisoner, sir?
Doctor nods. Officer steps forward.

CHIEF GUARD
If I might offer a word of advice, Doc. You'll have to watch this one. 
A right brutal bastard he has been, and will be again. In spite all his 
sucking up to the prison Chaplain and reading the Bible.

DOCTOR
Oh, I think we can manage things. Charlie, will you show the young man 
to his room now. 

CHARLIE
Right, sir. Come this way, please.
Alex exits with Officer.
 
INT. ALEX'S ROOM - LUDOVICO CENTRE - DAY
 
Alex finishing breakfast tray in bed.
Room bright and cheery.
Dr. Branom, a tall woman in her fifties, enters with nurse carrying a 
sterile tray.

DR. BRANOM
(very briskly)
Good morning, Alex, my name is Dr. Branom. I'm Doctor Brodsky's 
assistant.

ALEX
Good Morning, Missus. Lovely day, isn't it?

DR. BRANOM
Indeed it is. May I take this
She removes his tray.

DR. BRANOM
How're you feeling this morning?

ALEX
Fine... fine.

DR. BRANOM
Good. In a few minutes, you'll meeting Dr. Brodsky and we'll begin your 
treatment. You're a very lucky boy to have been chosen.

ALEX
I realise all that, Missus, and I'm very grateful to all concerned.

DR. BRANOM
We're going to friends now, sir.

ALEX
I hope so, Missus.
She inserts a needle into the medicine vial.

ALEX (CONT'D)
What's the hypo for then? Going to send me to sleep?

DR. BRANOM
Oh no, nothing of the sort.

ALEX
Vitamins will it be then?

DR. BRANOM
Something like that. You are a little undernourished, so after each 
meal were going to give you a shot. Roll over on your right side 
please, loosen your pyjama pants and pull them half-way down.
He does, somewhat reluctantly. She gives him a shot in the bum.

ALEX
What exactly is the treatment here going to be then?

DR. BRANOM
It's quite simple really. Were just going to show you some films.

ALEX
You mean like going to the pictures?

DR. BRANOM
Something like that.

ALEX
Well, that's good. I like to viddy the old films now and again.
 
INT. AUDIO VISUAL LUDOVICO CENTRE - DAY
Auditorium setting. Alex is bound in a examination chair in front of a 
large video screen. A white-coated Technician is strapping Alex's head 
to a medical device.
He then carefully attaches the eyelid locking to Alex's eyes.

ALEX (V.O.)
And viddy films I would. Where I was taken to, brothers, was like no 
cine I'd been in before. I was bound up in a straight-jacket and my 
gulliver was strapped to a headrest with like wires running away from 
it. Then they clamped like lidlocks on my eyes so I could not shut them 
no matter how hard I tried. It seemed a bit crazy to me, but I let them 
get on with what they wanted to get on with. If I was to be a free 
young malchick in a fortnight's time, I would put up with much in the 
meantime, my brothers.
At the back of the auditorium are ten or fifteen solemn medical 
Professionals in white coats watching the proceedings and occasionally 
taking notes. A film begins showing on the screen.
The Technician drops eyedrops into Alex's eyes.
 
VIOLENCE FILM
Man being beaten by four toughs wearing white.
Punches, kicks, grunts, blood.

ALEX (V.O.)
So far the first film was a very good professional piece of cine, 
looked like it was done in Hollywood.
Screams, moans, kicks, punches.

ALEX (V.O.)
The sounds were real horroshow. You could slooshy the screams and moans 
very realistic and you could even get the heavy breathing and panting 
of the tolchocking malchicks at the same time. And then, what do you 
know, soon our dear old friend, the red, red vino on tap. The same in 
all places like it's put out by the same big firm, began to flow. It 
was beautiful. It's funny how the colours of the real world only seem 
really real when you viddy them on a screen.
More kicks, punches, groans, thumps.
Girl being beaten, raped by six toughs.
Screams, music, laughing, grunts, heavy breathing.

ALEX (V.O.)
Now all the time I was watching this, I was beginning to get very aware 
of like not feeling all that well, but I tried to forget this, 
concentrating on the next film, which jumped right away on a young 
devotchka, who was being given the old in-out, in-out, first by one 
malchick, then another, then another. This seemed real, very real, 
though if you thought about it properly you couldn't imagine lewdies 
actually agreeing to having all this done to them in a film, and if 
these films were made by the good, or the State, you couldn't imagine 
them being allowed to take these films, without like interfering with 
what was going on.
Girl being raped.

ALEX (V.O.)
When it came to the sixth or seventh malchick, leering and smecking and 
then going into it, I began to feel really sick. But I could not shut 
my glazzies and even if I tried to move my glazballs about I still not 
get out of the line of fire of this picture.
Alex squirming and retching.
Dr. Brodsky clears his throat and quietly addresses his colleagues 
seated in the back of the room.

DR. BRODSKY
Very soon now the drug will cause the subject to experience a death-
like paralysis together with deep feelings of terror and helplessness. 
One of our earlier test subjects described it as being like death, a 
sense of stifling and drowning, and it is during this period we have 
found the subject will make his most rewarding associations between his 
catastrophic experience and environment and the violence he sees.
Alex retching violently and struggling against his strait jacket.

ALEX
Let me be sick... I want to get up. Get me something to be sick in... 
Stop the film... Please stop it... I can't stand it any more. Stop it 
please... please.
 
INT. ALEX'S ROOM - LUDOVICO - DAY

DR. BRANOM
Well, that was a very promising start. By my calculations, you should 
be starting to feel alright again. Yes? Dr. Brodsky's pleased with you. 
Now tomorrow there'll be two sessions, of course, morning and 
afternoon.

ALEX
You mean, I have to viddy two sessions in one day?

DR. BRANOM
I imagine you'll be feeling a little bit limp by the end of the day. 
But we have to be hard on you. You have to be cured.

ALEX
But it was horrible.

DR. BRANOM
Well, of course, it was horrible. Violence is a very horrible thing. 
That's what you're learning now. Your body is learning it.

ALEX
I just don't understand about feeling sick the way I did. I never used 
to feel sick before. I used to feel like the very opposite. I mean, 
doing it or watching it, I used to feel real horrorshow. I just don't 
understand why, how what.

DR. BRANOM
You felt ill this afternoon because you're getting better. You see, 
when we're healthy we respond to the presence of the hateful with fear 
and nausea. You're becoming healthy that's all. By this time tomorrow 
you'll be healthier still.
 
INT. AUDIO VISUAL LUDOVICO CENTRE - DAY
Alex retching and screaming - restrained again by a straight-jacket.

ALEX (V.O.)
It was the next day, brothers, and I had truly done my best, morning 
and afternoon, to play it their way and sit like a horrorshow co-
operative malchick in the chair of torture, while they flashed nasty 
bits of ultra-violence on the screen.; though not on the soundtrack, my 
brothers. The only sound being music. Then I noticed in all my pain and 
sickness what music it was that like cracked and boomed. It was Ludwig 
van - 9th symphony, 4th movement.

ALEX
Stop it... stop it, please!!! I beg of you!!! It's a sin!!! It's a 
sin!!! It's a sin, please!!!
Brodsky leans forward and turns down the sound.

DR. BRODSKY
What's all this about sin?

ALEX
That!... Using Ludwig van like that! He did no harm to anyone. 
Beethoven just wrote music.

DR. BRANOM
Are you referring to the background score?

ALEX
Yes!!!

DR. BRANOM
You've heard Beethoven before?

ALEX
Yes!!!

DR. BRODSKY
You're keen on music?

ALEX
Yes!!!

DR. BRANOM
(quietly)
What do you think about that, Dr. Brodsky?

DR. BRODSKY
(softly)
It can't be helped. Here's your punishment element perhaps. The 
Governor ought to be pleased... I'm sorry, Alex, this is for your own 
good, you'll have to bear with us for a while.

ALEX
You needn't take it any further, sir. You've proved to me that all this 
ultra-violence and killing is wrong and terribly wrong. I've learned my 
lesson, sir. I see now what I've never seen before I'm cured, praise 
Bog!

DR. BRODSKY
You're not cured yet, my boy.

DR. BRODSKY
You must take your chance boy. The choice has been all yours.

ALEX
But, Sir... Missus... I see that it's wrong! It's wrong because it's 
like against like society. It's wrong because everybody has the right 
to live and be happy without being tolchocked and knifed.

DR. BRODSKY
No, no, boy. You really must leave it to us, but be cheerful about it. 
In less than a fortnight now, you'll be a free man.
 
INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY
VIP audience including Minister, Junior Minister, Prison Governor, 
Priest, Dr. Branom, Dr. Brodsky.
Dressed in street clothes Alex enters led by a white-coated Technician.
He is led onto stage and left standing there, blinking into lights.
The Minister rises and walks to the front of the auditorium.

MINISTER
Ladies and Gentlemen, at this point, we introduce the subject himself. 
He is, as you will perceive, fit and well nourished. He comes straight 
from as night's sleep and a good breakfast, undrugged, unhypnotized. 
Tomorrow, we send him with confidence out into the world again, as 
decent a lad as you would meet on a May morning. What a change is here, 
Ladies and Gentlemen, from the wretched hoodlum the state committed to 
unprofitable punishment some two years ago, unchanged after two years. 
Unchanged, do I say - not quite. Prison taught him a false smile, the 
rubbed hands of hypocrisy, the fawning, greased, obsequious leer. Other 
vices prison taught him as well as confirming him in those he had long 
practised before. Our party promised to restore law and order and to 
make the streets safe for the ordinary peace loving citizen. This 
pledge is now about to become a reality. Ladies and Gentlemen, this is 
an historic moment. The problem of criminal violence is soon to be a 
thing of the past. But enough of words - act
He returns to his seat and leans close to his Junior Minister.

JUNIOR MINISTER
Our necks are out a long way on this, Minister.

MINISTER
I have complete faith in Brodsky. If the polls are right, we have 
nothing to lose.
Lights are dimmed. Enter Lardface, an elegantly dressed fag.

LARDFACE
Hello, heap of dirt. Pooh, you don't wash much do you, judging by the 
horrible smell.

ALEX
Why do you say that, brother? I had a shower this morning.

LARDFACE
Oh, he had a shower this morning. You trying to call me a liar?

ALEX
No, brother. What d'you want?

LARDFACE
What do I want?

ALEX
Sorry, brother. I didn't mean any offence.

LARDFACE
Oh. Oh, you're sorry are you, well you must think I'm awfully stupid.
He slaps Alex in the face.

ALEX
Why did you do that, brother? I've never done wrong to you.

LARDFACE
You want to know why I did that, well you see - I do that...
He stamps on Alex's foot.

LARDFACE
... and this...
He pulls Alex's nose.

LARDFACE
... and that...
He pulls Alex's ear, pushes him off balance and plants his foot on his 
chest.

LARDFACE
... because I don't like you horrible type, do I, and if you want to 
start something... if you want to start... go on... well, you just 
start. Please do.
Alex retching.

ALEX
I'm gonna be sick.

LARDFACE
You're gonna be sick are you?

ALEX
I wanna be sick.

LARDFACE
You wanna be sick?

ALEX
Let me get up.

LARDFACE
You wanna get up? Well, you've gotta you see... well I want you to lick 
it. Go on... Lick it.
Alex, gagging and coughing, licks the sole of his shoe.

LARDFACE
... And again... Go on!!! Again! There's a good boy.

ALEX (V.O.)
And, O my brothers, would you believe your faithful friend and long 
suffering narrator pushed out his red yahzik a mile and a half to lick 
the grahzny, vonny boots. The horrible killing sickness had wooshed up 
and turned the like joy of battle into a feeling I was going to snuff 
it.
Minister rises.

MINISTER
Enough! That will do very well. Thank you.
Lardface does leading-man-bows. A smattering of applause.

LARDFACE
Thank you very much, Ladies and Gentlemen... Thank you.
Alex on floor - still retching.
A beautiful nude Girl enters.
Alex looks up slowly.

ALEX (V.O.)
She came towards me with the light like it was the like light of 
heavenly grace, and the first thing that flashed into my gulliver was 
that I would like to have her right down there on the floor with the 
old in-out, real savage. But quick as a shot came the sickness, like a 
detective that had been watching around the corner and now followed to 
make his arrest.
Alex retching. Minister rises.

MINISTER
Thank you very much. Thank you my dear. 
Girl bows and exits to loud applause.

MINISTER
Not feeling too bad now are you?

ALEX
(pulling himself together)
No, sir, I feel really great.

MINISTER
Good.

ALEX
Was I alright, sir? Did I do well, sir?

MINISTER
Fine. Absolutely fine. You see, Ladies and Gentlemen our subject is, 
you see, impelled towards good by paradoxically being impelled toward 
evil. The intention to act violently is accompanied by strong feelings 
of physical distress. To counter these, the subject has to switch to a 
diametrically opposed attitude. Any questions?
Priest rises and moves to Alex.

PRIEST
Choice! The boy has no real choice, has he? Self interest, fear of 
physical pain drove him to that grotesque act of self abasement. Its 
insincerity was clearly to be seen. He ceases also to be a creature 
capable of moral choice.

MINISTER
Padre, these are subtleties. We are not concerned with motive, with the 
higher ethics; we are concerned only with cutting down crime. And with 
relieving the ghastly congestion in our prisons... He will be your true 
Christian, ready to turn the other cheek. Ready to be crucified rather 
than crucify, sick to the very heart at the thought even of killing a 
fly. Reclamation, joy before the angels of God. The point is that it 
works!
Applause.
 
EXT. FLATBLOCK
Alex walking carrying his prison parcel wrapped in brown paper.
 
INT. ALEX'S FLAT
Ma, Pa and Joe the Lodger reading newspapers. Headlines - all Alex.
Alex enters quietly. Loud radio music from sitting room prevents anyone 
from hearing him. He enters his won room which is the first off the 
hall.

ALEX
Hi. Hi. Hi, there my Pee and Em.
All three look up startled.

EM
Alex.

ALEX
(to his mother)
Hullo love, how are you?
(kisses her)
Nice to see you, Dad.

PEE
Hullo lad. What a surprise, good to see you.

ALEX
Keeping fit then?

PEE
(very ill at ease)
Fine, fine.

ALEX
Well, how are you then?

PEE
Oh fine, fi. Keeping out of trouble, you know.

ALEX
Well - I'm back.

PEE
(with feigned enthusiasm)
Aye. Glad to see you back, lad.

EM
Why didn't you let us know what was happening, son?

ALEX
Sorry, Em, I wanted it to be like... a big surprise for you and pee.

PEE
Well, it's a surprise all right, a bit bewildering too.

EM
We've only just read about it in the morning papers.

PEE
Aye. You should have let us know, lad, not that we're not very pleased 
to see you again. All cured too, eh?

ALEX
That's right, Dad they did a great job on my gulliver, I'm completely 
reformed.

PEE
Aye.

ALEX
(looks in the kitchen)
Well, still the same old place then, eh?

PEE
Oh, aye, aye.

ALEX
(fake whisper)
Hey, Dad, there's a strange fella sitting on the sofa there munchy-
wunching lomticks of toast.

PEE
Aye, that's Joe. He... ummmm, lives here now. The lodger. That's what 
he is... he... he rents your room.
Alex confronts Joe.

ALEX
How do you do, Joe? Find the room comfortable, do you? No complaints?

JOE
I've heard about you. I know what you've done. Breaking the hearts of 
your poor grieving parents. So you're back? You're back to make a life 
of misery for your lovely parents, is that it? Well, over my dead 
corpse you will, because you see, they've let me be more like a son to 
them than like a lodger.
Alex cocks his fist and starts to retch violently, almost at the same 
moment Joe drops back on the couch next to Em.

EM
Joe! Joe! Don't fight here boys!
Alex burps and retches.

JOE
Oh, please. Do put your hand over your mouth, it's bloody revolting.
Alex violently ill.

PEE
Well, what's the matter lad, are you feeling alright?

EM
Dad... It's the treatment.
More retching.

JOE
Well, it's disgusting. It puts you off your food.

EM
Leave him be, Joe. It's the treatment.

PEE
D'you think we should do something?

EM
Would you like me to make you a nice cup of tea, son?

ALEX
No thanks, Mum. It'll pass in a minute...
(after a pause)
... What have you done with all my own personal things?

PEE
Well. That was all took away, son, by the Police. New regulation about 
compensation for the victim.

ALEX
What about Basil? Where's my snake?

PEE
Oh well, he met with like an accident. He passed away.
Alex becomes a bit weepy.

ALEX
What's gonna happen to me then? I mean that's my room he's in - there's 
no denying that. This is my home also. What suggestions have you, my 
Pee and Em, to make?

PEE
Well, all this needs thinking about, son. I mean we can't very well 
just kick Joe out... Not just like that, can we? I mean Joe is here 
doing a job. A contract it is, two years. Well, we made like an 
arrangement, didn't we Joe? You see, son, Joe's paid next month's rent 
already so, well, whatever we do in the future, we cant just say to Joe 
to get out, now can we?

JOE
No, there's much more than that, though. I mean I've got you two to 
think of. I mean you're more like a mother and father to me. Well, it 
wouldn't be fair now, would it, for me to go off and leave you two to 
the tender mercies of this young monster who's been like no real son at 
all. Look, let him go off and find a room somewhere. Let him learn the 
errors of his way, and that a bad boy like he's been don't deserve such 
a good mum and dad as he's had.

ALEX
Alright. I see how things are now. I've suffered and I've suffered, and 
I've suffered and everybody wants me to go on suffering.

JOE
You've made others suffer. It's only fair that you should suffer 
proper. You know I've been told everything you've done, sitting here at 
night round the family table, pretty shocking it was to listen to. It 
made me real sick, a lot of it did. Now look what you've gone and done 
to your mother.
Em bursts into tears.

ALEX
So that's the way it is then, eh? That's the way it is. Right, I'm 
leaving now, you won't ever viddy me no more. I'll make my own way. 
Thank you very much. Let it lie heavy on your consciences.
Alex exits.

PEE
(shouting after him)
Now don't take it like that son.
Em boohoohoos, Joe comforts her.
 
EXT. AMBANKMENT - DAY
Alex walks along the Thames embankment still holding his paper parcel.
Tramp enters. The same man beaten by Alex and his gang earlier in the 
film.

TRAMP
Can you spare me some cutter, me brother? Can you spare some cutter, me 
brother?
Alex, without looking at him, reaches in his pocket and gives him some 
money.

TRAMP
Oh, thankyou, your honour.
The Tramp takes a second look at Alex.

TRAMP
Jamey Mack! Be the hokey fly! Holy Mother of God! All the Holy Angels 
and blessed saints in Heaven preserve us.
Alex breaks away but the Tramp toddles alongside him.

TRAMP
I never forget a face! I never forget any face, be God!

ALEX
Leave me alone, brother. I've never seen you before.
Tramp shouts to other Meths drinkers and Tramps.

TRAMP
This is the poisonous young swine that near done me in. Him and his 
friends beat me and kicked me and thumped me.
Alex breaks away again.

TRAMP
Stop him! Stop him!
A leg is stuck out and Alex goes down. The tramp swarm all over him.

TRAMP
They laughed at me blood and me moans. This murderous young pig is a 
prize specimen of the cowardly brutal young. He is in our midst and at 
our mercy. Give it to him. That's it.
Old Tramps begin to beat at Alex.

ALEX (V.O.)
Then there was like a sea of dirty, smelly old men trying to get at 
your humble Narrator, with their feeble rookers and horny old claws. It 
was Old Age having a go at Youth and I daren't do a single solitary 
thing, O my brothers, it being better to be hit at like that, than want 
to be sick and feel that horrible pain.
The Tramp crowd round Alex, shouting.

TRAMPS
Young hooligan... Vagabound... Kill him... Villain... Toad... 
Bastard... Kick his teeth in... Near killed poor old Jack, he did.
Police move in and push off crowd.

FIRST POLICEMAN
Alright, stop it now.

SECOND POLICEMAN
Alright, stop it now. Alright! Come on. Stop breaking the State peace. 
You naughty boys. Alright, that's enough.
Alex looks up.

ALEX
Oh, no.

DIM
Well, well, well, well, well, well, well, if it isn't little Alex. Long 
time no viddy, droog. How goes? Surprised are you?

ALEX
Impossible... I don't believe it.

GEORGIE
Evidence of the old glazzies. Nothing up our sleeves. No magic, little 
Alex? A job for two, who are now of job age. The police.
 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY
Police Landrover drives up.
Alex is pulled out by Georgie and Dim and hustled up a deserted lane.

DIM
Come on, Alex. Come for walkies. Hahahahaha.

ALEX
Come, come, my little droogies. I just don't get this at all. The old 
days are dead and gone. For what I did in the past I've been punished.

DIM
Been punished, yeah?

ALEX
I've been cured.

DIM
Been cured, yeah, that was read out to us. The Inspector read all that 
out to us. He said it was a very good way.

ALEX
I just don't get this all. It was them that went for me, brothers. 
You're not on their side and can't be. You can't be Dim. It was someone 
we fillied with back in the old days... Trying to get his own malenky 
bit of revenge after all this time. You remember, Dim?

DIM
Long time, is right. I don't remember them days too horrorshow. Don't 
call me Dim no more, either. Officer, call me.

GEORGIE
Enough is remembered though, little Alex.
Dim and Georgie laugh.
They drag Alex to a low water through.

DIM
This is to make sure you stay cured.
Georgie hits Alex in the stomach with his blackjack. Then, they push 
his head under the water and methodically start to beat him with their 
blackjacks.
After a full minute of this, they drag him out, halt-drowned,

DIM
(laughing)
Be viddying you some more, some time Alex.
 
EXT. "HOME" - NIGHT - HEAVY RAIN
Alex stumbles up the road to the entrance gate.

ALEX (V.O.)
Where was I to go, who had no home and no money. I cried for meself, 
Home, Home, Home. It was Home I was wanting and it was Home I came to, 
brothers, not realising in the state I was in, where I was and had been 
before.
Alex stumbles and crawls to the door.
 
INT. "HOME" - NIGHT
Mr. Alexander at his typewriter.
Julian a 6'4" - heavyweight weight-lifter lies across an exercise bench 
working with bar-bells.
The door bell rings.

MR. ALEXANDER
Who on earth could that be?

JULIAN
I'll see who it is.
He to the door.

JULIAN
Yes, what is it?
No reply. He opens the door. Alex falls into the hall.

ALEX
(barely audible)
Help. Help me... Help me... Police.
Julian picks him up like a child and carries him into the living room.
 
INT. "HOME" - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

ALEX (V.O.)
And would you believe it, O my brothers and only friends, there was 
your faithful Narrator being held helpless, like a babe in arms, and 
suddenly realising where I was and why HOME on the gate had looked so 
familiar. But I knew I was safe. I knew he would not remember me for, 
in those carefree days, I and my so-called droogs wore our maskies 
which were like real horrorshow disguises.

JULIAN
Frank, I think this young man needs help.

MR. ALEXANDER
Dear, dear, dear. Whatever happened to you, my boy?
Mr. Alexander, now confined to a wheelchair, pushes himself away from 
his desk, and rolls up to Julian. The water drips off Alex's clothes. 
They look at each other.

ALEX
The police... The horrible ghastly Police. They beat me up, sir. The 
Police beat me up, sir.
Mr. Alexander stares at him. It becomes apparent he is insane.

MR. ALEXANDER
I know who you are! Isn't it your picture in the newspapers? Didn't I 
see you this morning on the video? Are you not the poor victim of this 
horrible new technique?

ALEX
Yes, sir, that's exactly who I am, sir... and what I am... a victim, 
sir.
Mr. Alexander becomes frenzied as the speech progresses.

MR. ALEXANDER
Then, by God, you have been sent here by providence. Tortured in 
prison, then thrown out to be tortured by the Police. My heart goes out 
to you, poor, poor boy. Oh, you are not the first to come here in 
distress. The Police are fond of bringing their victims to the 
outskirts of this village. But it is providential that you, who are 
also another kind of victim, should come here. But you're cold and 
shivering. Julian, draw a bath for this young man.

JULIAN
Certainly, Frank.
He carries Alex off.

ALEX
Thank you very much, sir. God bless you, sir.
Alexander bites his hand.
 
INT. "HOME" - BATHROOM
Alex soaks, eyes closed, in a hot tub.
After a while he begins softly singing to himself: "Singin' in the 
Rain".
 
INT. "HOME" - LIVING ROOM - DAY
Mr. Alexander is hunched over the phone, talking in hoarse whipsers. 
The door to the bathroom is right behind him. While he speaks Mr. 
Alexander throws nervous glances over his shoulder.

MR. ALEXANDER
I tell you, sir, they have turned this young man into something other 
than a human being. He has no power of choice any more. He's committed 
to socially acceptable acts, a little machine capable only of good... 
He can be the most potent weapon imaginable to ensure that the 
Government is not returned at the next election. The Government's great 
boast, as you know sir, is the way they have dealt with crime in the 
last few months. Recruiting brutal young roughs into the police, 
proposing debilitation and will-sapping techniques of conditioning. Oh, 
we've seen it all before in other countries The thin end of the wedge. 
Before we know where we are we shall have the full apparatus of 
totalitarianism. This young boy is a living witness to these diabolical 
proposals. The people - the common people - must know... must see! 
There are rare traditions of liberty to defend. The tradition of 
liberty means all. The common people will let it go! Oh, yes - they 
will sell liberty for a quieter life. That is why they must be le
Trembling with excitement and madness, Mr. Alexander hangs up the 
phone. His eyes, shiny with anticipation. Then, suddenly, he becomes 
aware of Alex's voice coming from the other side of the door.
 
INT. "HOME" - BATHROOM
Alex in bath, singing.

ALEX
I'm singing in the rain,
Just singing in the rain...
 

MR. ALEXANDER
His face horribly distorted in a Homeric rage.
 
INT. "HOME" - NIGHT
Alex, alone, in complete silence. Eating a large plate of spaghetti. 
The giant, Julian, appears, carrying Mr. Alexander in his wheelchair. 
He deposits him at the table.

ALEX
Good evening, sir.

MR. ALEXANDER
(very weird)
Good evening.

ALEX
It was very kind of you to leave this out for me, sir. There was no-one 
around when I finished my bath, so I started. I hope that's alright, 
sir.

MR. ALEXANDER
(too loud - voice out of control)
Of course. Food alright?

ALEX
Great, sir. Great.

MR. ALEXANDER
Try the wine!

ALEX
Thank you very much, sir. Cheers
Suddenly the thought occurs to Alex that the wine may be drugged or 
poisoned.

ALEX
Won't you join me, sir?

MR. ALEXANDER
No, my health doesn't allow it.

ALEX
(to Julian)
And you, sir?

JULIAN
No thank you.
Alex, stalling for time, reaches for bottle and reads the label.

ALEX
1960, Chateau, Saint Estephe, Medoc, very good brand, sir.
He doesn't get a penny's change for his remarks from Alexander and 
Julian.
He holds the glass up to the light.

ALEX
Very good colour, sir. Smells mice, too.Very good number, sir. Very 
good. Here's to it.
He downs the glass.

ALEX
Very refreshing, sir, very refreshing.

MR. ALEXANDER
(very arch)
I'm so pleased you appreciate good wine. Have another glass!

ALEX
Thank you, sir.

MR. ALEXANDER
My wife...
Alex freezes.

MR. ALEXANDER
... used to do everything for me and leave me to my writing.

ALEX
Your wife, sir? Has she gone away?

MR. ALEXANDER
No. She's dead!

ALEX
I'm sorry to hear about that, sir.
His face contorted in rage.

MR. ALEXANDER
She was very badly raped, you see. We were assaulted by a gang of 
vicious young hooligans in this house, in this very room you're sitting 
in now. I was left a helpless cripple. The doctors said it was 
Pneumonia, because it happened some months later during the 'flu 
epidemic. The doctors told me it was Pneumonia, but I knew what it was. 
A victim of the modern age, poor, poor girl.
Suddenly his mood changes. He wheels right up to Alex.

MR. ALEXANDER
And now you, another victim of the modern age. But you can be helped. I 
phoned some friends while you were having a bath.

ALEX
Phoned some friends, sir?

MR. ALEXANDER
Yes. They want to help.

ALEX
Help me, sir?

MR. ALEXANDER
Help you.

ALEX
Who are they, sir?

MR. ALEXANDER
They're very, very important people and they're interested in you.
Bell rings. Julian rises,

MR. ALEXANDER
Julian. This will be these people now.
Alex gets up.

ALEX
Look, sir. I'm sorry to have troubled you. I think I ought to be going, 
sir.
Julian bars the way.

MR. ALEXANDER
No, no my boy. No trouble at all.
Alex slowly sits.

MR. ALEXANDER
Have another glass of wine.
He pours. Alex picks up glass and takes a drink.
 
INT. "HOME" - NIGHT
Dolin and Rubinstein enter with Julian.

DOLIN
(genial)
Hullo, Frank.

MR. ALEXANDER
Good evening, sir.

RUBINSTEIN
Frank.

DOLIN
So this is the young man?

ALEX
How do you do, sir?

DOLIN
Hullo.

ALEX
Missus. Very pleased to meet you.

RUBINSTEIN
Hullo.

DOLIN
I hope you forgive us for coming over at this ungodly hour, but we 
heard from Frank that you were in some trouble so we came over to see 
if we could be of any help.

ALEX
Very kind of you, sir. Thank you very much.

DOLIN
I understand that you had a rather unfortunate encounter with the 
Police tonight.

ALEX
Yes, sir. I suppose you might call it that, sir.

DOLIN
Hahaha, and how are you feeling now?

ALEX
Much better, thank you, sir.

DOLIN
Feel like talking to us. Answering a few questions?

ALEX
Fine, sir, fine.

DOLIN
Well, as I've said, we've heard about you. We are interested in your 
case. We want to help you.

ALEX
Thank you very much, sir.

DOLIN
But first we'd like to find out a few things about you.

ALEX
What would you like to know, sir?

DOLIN
Well, shall we get down to it?

ALEX
Yes, sir.
Rubinstein takes out a notebook.

RUBINSTEIN
The newspapers mentioned that in addition to your being conditioned 
against acts of sex and violence, you've inadvertently been conditioned 
against music.

ALEX
Well, er, I think that was something that they hadn't planned for, you 
see, Missus, I'm very fond of music and always have been, especially 
Beethoven, Ludwig van... Beethoven. B... E... E...
He leans over and looks at her writing in notebook.

RUBINSTEIN
It's alright, thank you.

ALEX
And it just so happened that while they were showing me a particularly 
bad film, of like a concentration camp, the background music was 
playing Beethoven.

RUBINSTEIN
So now you have the same reaction to music as you do to sex and 
violence?

ALEX
Oh well, it's... it's not all music you see, Missus. It's just the 9th.

RUBINSTEIN
You mean Beethoven's 9th Symphony?

ALEX
That's right. Er... I can't listen to the 9th any more at all. When I 
hear the 9th, I get like this funny feeling.

RUBINSTEIN
When you say this funny feeling, you mean the state of mind brought on 
by the treatment they gave you?

ALEX
That is correct, sir. And then all I can think about is like trying to 
snuff it.

RUBINSTEIN
I beg your pardon?

ALEX
Snuff it, sir... um... death, I mean, missus... Er... I just want to 
die peacefully like with no... pain.

RUBINSTEIN
Do you feel that way now?

ALEX
Um... oh no, sir, not exactly, I still feel very miserable, very much 
down in spirits.

RUBINSTEIN
Do you still feel suicidal?

ALEX
Um... well, put it this way... I feel very low in myself. I can't see 
much in the future, and I feel that any second something terrible is 
going to happen to me.
He pitches forward, face into the plate of spaghetti.

RUBINSTEIN
Well done, Frank. Julian, get the car, will you please?
 
INT. HI-FI ROOM - DAWN
Alexander sits looking up. Rubinstein, Julian and Dolin also listening 
to Beethoven played loudly on tape recorder.
 
INT. DOLIN'S HOUSE - PRISONER BEDROOM - DAY
The 9th Symphony booming up through the floor.
Alex slowly regains consciousness.

ALEX (V.O.)
I woke up. The pain and sickness all over me like an animal. Then I 
realised what it was. The music coming up from the floor was our old 
friend, Ludwig van and the dreaded 9th Symphony.
He staggers to the door. It is locked. He kicks and tugs the door.

ALEX
Open the door... turn it off... turn it off.
CUT TO:
 
THE BILLIARD ROOM BELOW
Hi-Fi gear laid out on the table. Large speakers facing upwards. Mr. 
Alexander trembles and twitches. He is now completely mad. The others 
merely wait, coolly.
 
INT. DOLIN'S HOUSE - PRISONER BEDROOM - DAY
Alex on his knees. His hands cupped over his ears, banging his head on 
the floor.
Then he stops and slowly straightens up, staring at the window.

ALEX (V.O.)
Suddenly I viddied what I had to do, and what I had wanted to do - and 
that was to do myself in, to snuff it, to blast off forever out of this 
wicked cruel world. One moment of pain perhaps and then sleep - forever 
and ever and ever.
 
EXT. WINDOW - DAWC
Alex leaps out of the window.
 
INT. HOSPITAL WARD
Alex in bed. Camera slowly tracks along length of his body. Everything 
is bandages and plaster splints, wire cages, blood drips.

ALEX (V.O.)
I jumped, O my brothers, and I fell hard but I did not snuff it, oh no. 
if I had snuffed it, I would not be here to tell what I have told. I 
came back to life, after a long, black, black gap of what might have 
been a million years.
We hear Alex moan, and then another moan. Alex and the other - a few 
times.
Suddenly, some curtains which have been drawn around another bed in the 
ward are parted, and a nurse hurries to Alex, hastily buttoning up her 
uniform. She is trailed by a young Intern fumbling with his trousers.

NURSE
Oh, he's recovered conscienceness, Doctor.
 
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Em and Pee sitting around the bed.

PEE
Hullo, lad.

EM
Hullo, son, how are you?

PEE
Are you feeling better?

ALEX
What gives, O my Pee and Em, what makes you think you are welcome?
Em sobs. Pee comforts her.

PEE
There, there mother, it's alright. He doesn't mean it. You were in the 
papers again, son. It said they had done great wrong to you. It said 
how the Government drove you to try and do yourself in... and when you 
think about it, son... maybe it was our fault too in a way... your 
home's your home when it's all said and done, son.
Em sobs.
 
INT. HOSPITAL
Psychiatrist wheels trolley to Alex's bed. He is sitting up.

ALEX
Good morning, Missus.

DR. TAYLOR
How are you feeling today?

ALEX
Fine. Fine.

DR. TAYLOR
Good. I'm doctor Taylor.

ALEX
I haven't seen you before.

DR. TAYLOR
I'm your Psychiatrist.

ALEX
Psychiatrist? Huh, do I need one?

DR. TAYLOR
Just part of hospital routine.

ALEX
What are we going to do? Talk about me sex life?

DR. TAYLOR
No... I'm going to show you some slides and you are going to tell me 
what you think about them Alright?

ALEX
Ohhh... jolly good. Perhaps you can explain me something to me first.

DR. TAYLOR
Yes?

ALEX
Well, when I was all like ashamed up and half awake and unconscious 
like, I kept having this dream like all these doctors were playing 
around with me gulliver. You know... like the inside of me brain. I 
seemed to have this dream over and over again. D'you think it means 
anything?

DR. TAYLOR
Patients who've sustained the kind of injuries you have often have 
dreams of this sort. It's all part of the recovery process.

ALEX
Oh.

DR. TAYLOR
Now then, each of these slides needs a reply from one of the people in 
the picture. You'll tell me what you think the person would say. 
Alright?

ALEX
Righty, right.
The doctor reads aloud the dialogue printed in the cartoon balloon - a 
peacock.

DR. TAYLOR
Isn't the plumage beautiful?

ALEX
I just say what the other person would say?

DR. TAYLOR
Yes. Yes, well don't think about it too long, just say the first thing 
that pops into your mind.

ALEX
Right... Knickers... Cabbages... It doesn't have a beak.
Alex laughs. Slide of woman speaking to boy.

DR. TAYLOR
Good. The boy you always quarrelled with is seriously ill.

ALEX
That's right and I'll smash your face for you, yarblockos.
Slide of watch shop.

DR. TAYLOR
Good. It wa your fault... you sold me a crummy watch. I want my money 
back.

ALEX
Bollocks. You know what you can do with that watch? You can stick it up 
your arse.
Slide of nude woman in bed, a man at the window.

DR. TAYLOR
Good. What do you want?

ALEX
Excuse me, missus. No time for the old in-out, I've just come to read 
the meter.
Slide of bird's nest with eggs.

DR. TAYLOR
Good. You can do whatever you like with these.

ALEX
Eggiwegs. I would like to smash 'em. Pick up th elot and f... owww...
He slams his hand down and cries out with pain.

ALEX
Fucking hell...

DR. TAYLOR
Fine. Well, that's all there is to it. Are you alright?

ALEX
I hope so. Is that the end then?

DR. TAYLOR
Yes.

ALEX
I was quite enjoying that.

DR. TAYLOR
Good. I'm glad

ALEX
How many did I get right?

DR. TAYLOR
It's not that kind of a test. But you seem well on the way to a 
complete recovery.

ALEX
And when do I get out of here then?

DR. TAYLOR
I'm sure it won't be long now.
 
INT. HOSPITAL - DAY
Alex sitting up, being fed by Nurse.

ALEX (V.O.)
So I waited and, O my brothers, I got a lot better munching away at 
eggiwegs, and lomticks of toast and lovely steakiweaks and then, one 
day, they said I was going to have a very special visitor.
Doctor enters followed by Minister and Matron.

MINISTER
Good evening, my boy.

ALEX
Hi, hi, hi there, my little droogies.

DOCTOR
Well, how are you getting on today, young man?

ALEX
Great, sir. Great.

DOCTOR
Can I do anything more for you , Minister?

MINISTER
I don't think so, Sir Leslie. Thank you very much.

DR. TAYLOR
Then I'll leave you to it. Nurse.
They exit. Minister moves to Alex.

MINISTER
You seem to have a whole ward to yourself, my boy.

ALEX
Yes, sir, and a very lovely place it is too, sir, when I wake up in the 
middle of the night with my pain.

MINISTER
Yes... well good to see you on the mend. I've kept in constant touch 
with the hospital, of course, and now I've come to see you personally 
to see how you're getting along.

ALEX
I've suffered the tortures of the damned. The tortures of the damned, 
sir.

MINISTER
Yes I can... Oh look, let me do that for you, shall I?

ALEX
Thank you, sir.

MINISTER
I can tell you that I... and the Government of which I am a member are 
deeply sorry about this, my boy. Deeply sorry. We tried to help you. We 
followed recommendations had been made to us that turned out to be 
wrong. An enquiry will place the responsibility where it belongs. We 
want you to regard us as friends. We've put you right, you're the best 
of treatments. We never wished you harm, but there are some that did 
and do, and I think you know who those are. There are certain people 
who wanted to use you for political ends. People who would have been 
glad to have you dead because then they would have been able to blame 
it all on the Government. I think you know who those are. There is also 
a certain man - a writer of subversive literature - who has been 
howling for your blood. He's been mad with desire to stick a knife into 
you, but you're safe from him now, we've put him away. He found out 
that you had done wrong to him - at least he believed you had done 
wrong. He had formed this idea in his head that you h

ALEX
Where is he now, sir?

MINISTER
We put him away where he can do you no harm. You see we are looking 
after your interests. We are interested in you, and when you leave here 
you will have no further worries. We shall see to everything... a good 
job on a good salary.

ALEX
What job and how much?

MINISTER
You must have an interesting job at a salary which you would regard as 
adequate. Not only for the job which you are going to do and in 
compensation for what you believe you have suffered, but also because 
you are helping us.

ALEX
Helping you, sir?

MINISTER
We always help our friends, don't we?
(smiles)
It is no secret that the Government has lost a lot of popularity 
because of you, my boy. There are some that think that at the next 
election we shall be out. The press has chosen to take a very 
unfavourable view of what we tried to do.

ALEX
Well, who can blame them, sir?

MINISTER
Mmmm, possibly. Yes. But public opinion has a way of changing and you, 
Alex, if I may call you, Alex?

ALEX
Certainly, sir. What do they call you at home?

MINISTER
My name is Frederick. As I was saying, Alex, you can be instrumental in 
changing the public verdict. Do you understand, Alex? Have I made 
myself clear?

ALEX
As an unmuddied lake, Fred. As clear as an azure sky of deepest summer. 
You can rely on me, Fred.

MINISTER
Good... good boy. Oh yes, I understand you're fond of music. I have 
arranged a little surprise for you.

ALEX
Surprise?

MINISTER
One I think you will like... as a, how shall I put it, as a symbol of 
our new understanding. An understanding between two friends.

ALEX
Thank you, Fred. Thank you.
Minister turns and signals.
Door opens and a crowd of cameramen and reporters rush in.
Aides push two 6-foot loudspeakers and a Hi-Fi on a trolley.

ALEX (V.O.)
And what do you know, my brothers and only friends, it was the 9th, the 
glorious 9th of Ludwig van. Oh, it was gorgeosity and yummy yum yum. I 
was cured.
 
CLOSE SHOT ALEX

ALEX (V.O.)
As the music came to its climax, I could viddy myself very clear, 
running and running on like very light and mysterious feet, carving the 
whole face of the creeching world with my cut throat britva. I was 
cured all right.
 
 
THE END
