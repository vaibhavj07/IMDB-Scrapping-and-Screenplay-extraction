I've got four Lamborghinis
that can't meet smog emission standards.
How many times
you wash out with E.P.A.?
Sir, they're
clearing E.P.A. in a few days.
Three times?
You're on a roll.
Four cars, three times each.
That's zip for twelve.
Are you a mechanic
or a NASA engineer?
I told you I've never
dealt with Lamborghinis...
and yet you assured me that you could
deliver the cars within that time frame.
Don't tell me that,
'cause I'm not even listening.
Sir, I hardly think
that's necessary.
I'll explain that
to my swing loan.
I'm into him for 200,000.
That's thousand, three zeros.
I got my money tied up in these cars.
If I don't get it, I am finished.
- Do you understand that?
- You have to understand our situation.
I got a shark snappin' at my heels.
They could've taken the car
and my business 11 days ago.
I am holding them off
with a whip and a chair.
I understand that.
I know delivery is way overdue.
This fuckin' E.P.A.!
The whole world is chokin' on smog...
and they're gonna correct the situation
by keeping my four cars off the road?
Babbitt Collectibles.
Have you tried cash?
How much do these E.P.A. guys earn?
Charlie, Mr. Wyatt.
- Wyatt?
- Yeah, about the swing Loan.
If he doesn't get the money by 5:30,
he's gonna come and seize all the cars.
- I have to call you back.
- You should talk to Mr. Babbitt.
Tell him you watched me sign the check
on Tuesday, then you put it in the mail.
I need this.
Come on.
I wouldn't do that until
you talk to Mr. Babbitt.
His number?
He's on the road now.
- He wants you to call him immediately.
- Charlie--
Tell him I'm connecting to Barbados,
arriving 1:
30 a.m.
- Charlie!
- Lenny, I'm standing right here.
Mr. Bateman wants to back out on his car
and he wants to take Mr. Webb with him.
They want their down payments back.
They found two cars at Valley Motors.
Tell him that that was me on the line,
the cars just passed emissions...
and the E.P.A. paperwork
will be in here momentarily.
- You payin' attention to me?
- Yeah, I'm Listening.
Tell them also that I'm knocking off
five grand on both their deals.
- Do you understand that, Lenny?
- I got it.
Mr. Bateman, that was
Mr. Babbitt on the other Line.
As it happens,
the cars are passing emissions--
What am I saying?
The cars have passed emissions.
We're waiting for the E.P.A. paperwork.
We'll have that momentarily.
And because of your
incredible patience...
we're going to knock off $5,000
on each car.
Well, yes,
you've been most patient.
We really appreciate your patience.
Well, thank you.
Thank you.
Ready for Palm Springs?
You still want to go
with all these problems?
We're seconds away from closing
this deal, clearing 75 grand.
- Not bad for a couple of phone calls.
- No, not bad at all.
- You know where to find us, right?
- Right.
I got it under control.
I don't want to be demanding...
but could you possibly say 10 or
Consider it foreplay.
Can you include me
in some of your thoughts?
I'm just thinkin'.
Nothing special.
Maybe there's something that
you're thinking about that we can talk.
If there was, Susanna,
we'd be talkin' about it.
What's the big to-do
about me thinkin'?
I just feel like I'm going away for
a few days with someone. Call me crazy.
You wanna talk? Let's talk.
How was your day?
I feel you're excluding me from what's
going on. It's not that I wanna talk.
One of these again, Susanna.
How did we get back to one of these?
I don't want to-- I don't know
why I put up with all of this.
You wanted to go to Palm Springs,
and we're goin'.But I didn't wanna go alone.
I've been sitting in this car for--
You wanna talk?
Let's talk!
This is not talking.
- Yeah?
- Charlie, this is Lenny.
I've been trying to contact you
for a while.
I got a long-distance call from
Mr. Mooney, your father's lawyer.
He's been trying to reach you.
Your father has died, Charlie.
I'm sorry. The funeral's tomorrow
in Cincinnati. He said you'd know where.
- I've got his number.
- That's not necessary.
Anything else?
- If there's anything I can do--
- All right.
- I'm sorry about the weekend, hon.
- Charlie, the weekend?
I told you before,
we had a falling-out a Long time ago.
My mother died when I was two.
It was just him and me.
We just didn't get along.
- You're going to the funeral, no?
- Yeah.
- I'm coming with you.
- That's sweet, but there's no point.
I want to.
All right. Sorry.
I forgot who I was talkin' to.
...to our beloved neighbor...
for our memory, admiration
and respect for him...
will live beyond the years
of his life on Earth.
Let us consecrate ourselves to follow
his example of zest for Life...
dedication to family...
and charity to all.
And now, with sure and certain hope
of resurrection Life...
we commend to you
the soul of our departed friend.
Just have to go over the details of
the will with him, and then we leave.
I can wait in the car.
Somebody should be watering those roses.
They're all dying.
Knew this car my whole Life.
Only drove it once.
A 1949 Buick Roadmaster convertible.
Only 8,000 production models made.
Straight-Eight.
Fireball Eight.
It was the first full year
of the Dynaflow transmission.
Know it by rote.
You were his only child.
You came along when he was...
what, 45 or something?
He probably thought
he was never going to have a son...so he had to love you.
I think you're exaggerating.
You were his child, his son, his blood.
In these pictures here, he doesn't look
Like a man who doesn't love his son.
What are you doin' lookin' at this?
Put that away.
- You want to hear a story?
- Don't get mad.
You know the convertible in the garage?
His baby, that and the goddamn roses.
- The Buick.
- The car was off-limits to me.
'That's a classic,' he'd say.
'It's not for children.'
Tenth grade, I'm 16 years old,
and for once...
I bring home a report card,
and it's almost all A's.
I go to my old man,
'Can I take the car out?'
Take the guys out in the Buick,
sort of a victory drive.
He says, 'No.'
I steal the keys, I sneak it out.
You took the car with no permission?
Why? Why then?
Because l--
I deserved it.
Nothing I did was good enough for
this guy. Don't you understand that?
We're on Columbia Parkway,
four kids.
- We get pulled over.
- An accident?
Pulled over.
- What is pulled over? Police?
- Yes, police.
Can I finish?
He called in a report of a stolen car.
Not 'his son took the car
without permission.' Just 'stolen.'
Central Station. The other guys' dads
bail 'em out in an hour.
- He left me there two days.
- He left you in prison two days?
Two days.
Were you scared?
Yeah, I was scared.
Left home.
I never saw him again.
Charlie, after a year
we've been together...
this is the first time
I've heard this story.
It's strange, huh?
I mean, how can you keep all this
inside you and not say anything?
When I was a kid and I got scared,
the Rain Man would come and sing to me.
The rain what?
You know, one of those
imaginary childhood friends.
- What happened to him?
- Nothin'. I just grew up.
Not so much.
'And I remember, too,
the day you left home...so full of bitterness
and grandiose ideas.
So full of yourself.
And being raised without a mother,
the hardness of your heart...
is understandable as well.
Your refusal to even pretend
that you loved or respected me...
all these I forgive.
But your failure to write, to telephone,
to reenter my Life in any way...
has left me without a son.
I wish you all I ever wanted for you.
I wish you the best.'
'l hereby bequeath to my son,
Charles Sanford Babbitt...
that certain Buick convertible...
the very car that, unfortunately,
brought our relationship to an end.
Also, outright title to my
prizewinning hybrid rose bushes.
May they remind him
of the value of excellence...
and the possibility of perfection.
As for my home and all other property,
real and personal...
these shall be placed in trust
in accordance with the terms of...
that certain instrument
executed concurrently herewith.'
What does that mean?
It means that the estate,
in excess of $3 million...
after expenses and taxes,
will go into a trust fund...
for a beneficiary
to be named in this document.
- Who is that?
- I'm afraid I can't tell you that.
- Who controls the money? You?
- No. He's called a trustee.
What is that?
How does that work?
Forgive me,
but there's nothing more I can say.
I'm sorry, son.
I can see that you're disappointed.
Why should I be disappointed?
I got rose bushes, didn't l?
What's his name got--
- What'd you call him? The--
- Beneficiary.
He got $3 million,
but he didn't get the rose bushes.
I definitely got
the rose bushes.
- Charles.
- I mean, those are rose bushes.
- There's no need--
- To what?
To be upset?
To be upset?
If there is a hell, sir,
my father's in it...
and he is looking up right now
and he is laughing his ass off.Sanford Babbitt. You wanna be
that guy's son for five minutes?
- Were you Listening to that letter?
- Yes, sir, I was.
Were you?
No. Could you repeat it?
'Cause I can't believe my fuckin' ears.
I was looking for you.
How did it go?
I got what I expected.
Susanna, this could take
a few minutes.
- Can I help you?
- I think you can.
I have a problem with a private trust
and-- That's a terrific suit.
- Thank you.
- My father was Sanford Babbitt.
Is this Wallbrook?
Excuse me.
Is this Wallbrook?
Excuse me.
Dr. Bruner is still in conference.
Would you Like
to wait in his office?
No, we'll stay here.
Thank you.
Maybe we're not supposed
to be looking around here.
Good to have you here.
Good luck to all three of you.
Twenty dollars starts you all
on an important match.
In what 1980 comedy film did Goldie Hawn
get away from it all? Lisa?
- 'Private Benjamin.'
- Excuse me, please.
I'd Like to watch
the TV, please.
For whose grandson was the
presidential retreat Camp David named?
- Lisa?
- Eisenhower.
Right, for David Eisenhower.
You've got another five.
Ten-dollar lead for Lisa.
In days of yore, what would
a swashbuckler keep in his sheath?
Whatever this is, I don't understand
the point of secrecy.
This patient is an old
girlfriend of my father's?
I knew your father
since you were two years old.
The year my mother died.
I'm trustee of the fund, but this
hospital receives nothing from that.
Maybe that's something
we could discuss.
I took on this burden out of loyalty
to your father. My loyalty ends there.
And you think
I should feel that loyalty?
I think you feel cheated
out of your birthright...
by a man who had
difficulty showing love.
And I think if I were in your shoes,
I'd probably feel the same.I was hoping that we could talk, that
you would explain my father's side...
help me understand
the right in what he's done.
Because, failing that,
I have responsibilities of my own...
and they have to be met,
even if that means a fight.
I'm sorry,
this is not your car.
Yeah, my dad lets me
drive slow on the driveway.
- I'm an excellent driver.
- Are you sure that you drive this car?
There's only 28 miles on the odometer
since I drove it a week ago Saturday.
- Should be more than 28 miles.
- Look, my boyfriend is coming.
Of course, today's Monday.
I always drive the car on Saturday.
Never drive on a Monday.
- Who is this guy?
- He jumped into the car.
- Well, he can jump out.
- I'm an excellent driver.
Yeah, that's good. Come on.
I don't have time for this shit.
Why'd you let him get in?
This is not a toy.
- He says he drives this car.
- Dad lets me drive every Saturday.
Of course, the seats were
originally brown leather.
Now they're pitiful red.
You know, these seats
were brown leather.
- You know this car?
- I know this car.
- How do you know this car?
- I definitely know this car.
It's a 1949 Buick Roadmaster.
Straight-Eight. Fireball Eight.
Only 8,095 production models.
Dad lets me drive on the driveway,
but not on Monday.
- Definitely not on Monday.
- Who's your dad?
- Sanford Babbitt.
- Who? Sanford Babbitt?
Cincinnati, Ohio.
That's my address.
What is it with this guy? Hey!
- Who's your mother?
- Eleanor Babbitt.
- Eleanor?
- Died January 5th, 1965.
Who the hell are you?
Wait a second. Where are you goin'?
Thirteen minutes to Judge Wapner
and 'The People's Court.'
I wanna ask you a question.
What you are witnessing is real.
The participants are not actors--
- I'm talkin' to you!
- They're actual litigants.Bruner, who is this guy?
Raymond is your brother.
My brother?
I don't have a brother.
...and have your disputes
settled here in our forum:
'The People's Court.'
'The People's Court.'
'The People's Court.'
Hello, I'm Doug Llewelyn,
and welcome to 'The People's Court.'
- What is he, crazy?
- No.
- Is he retarded?
- Not exactly.
- Not crazy or retarded, but he's here.
- He's an autistic savant.
I don't know what that means.
People Like him used to
be called 'idiot savants.'
They have certain deficiencies,
certain abilities.
- Well, he's retarded.
- Autistic.
- Actually, high-functioning.
- What does that mean?
It means that there's a disability
that impairs the sensory input...
and how it's processed.
English here.
You're talkin' over my head.
Raymond has a problem
communicating and learning.
He can't even express himself
or probably even...
understand his own emotions
in a traditional way.
And after that, the dog bit him.
I yelled at my dog.
There are dangers
everywhere for Raymond.
Routines, rituals--
It's all he has to protect himself.
Rituals. That's a good one.
Well, it's the way he acts...
sleeps, eats, uses the bathroom,
walks, talks, everything.
- Breaking a routine is terrifying.
- How Long has he been here?
- I came here in 1960.
- How old is he?
He was 18 or 20 then.
I have to check the records.
- You've been here that Long?
- That's when I started.
So that's '65, '75, '85--
I was almost three years old.
You knew he had a brother.
You knew I was his brother.
- Yes, but what's the point?
- What's the fuckin' point?
- Why wasn't I told I had a brother?
- What would you have done about it?
I don't know.
Does he know how much money
he's been left?
No. He doesn't understand
the concept of money.He doesn't understand
the concept of money.
He's just inherited $3 million...
and he doesn't understand
the concept of money?
Well, that is fuckin' poetic,
don't you think?
Good ol' Dad.
What's his name? Yes.
Then who's playing first? Yes.
Who? The fellow playing
first base for St. Louie. Who?
Why is he doin' that?
Whenever he gets nervous,
he does 'Who's On First?'
- Yeah, why?
- Why?
It's his way of dealing with you
touching his books and stuff.
- So he memorized 'Who's On First?'
- That, among other things.
- Ted Kloszevski.
- Kluszewski.
Ted Kluszewski. 'Big Klu.'
First base.
- He played for Cincinnati.
- Traded for Dee Fondee, 1957.
- Lifetime batting average, .298.
- He reads all these great books, huh?
Reads and remembers
whatever he gets his hands on.
Vern. V-E-R-N. Of course, these people
are gonna be here all day, Vern.
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.
-This is definitely not a weekend visit.
-He's gettin' anxious.
- It's okay, Ray.
- Vern.
This is an unannounced visit, Vern.
- He said not to touch the books!
- Not to touch books.
- You Like Shakespeare?
- I don't know.
- Did you read all this?
- I don't know. Vern?
- Did you read 'MacBeth'?
- I don't know.
- Vern?
- 'The Twelfth Night'?
- Stop it!
- Yes.
You read all the stories in this book,
and you don't know if you read the book?
- I don't know.
- You don't know?
Maybe you'd better put it back.
You don't know.
Okay, Ray, take it easy.
I won't touch anything else, Ray.
It's okay, Ray.
Come on. My main man.
Vern, my main man.
My main man Vern.
It's okay, Ray.
- My main man.
- My main man.
Here are your cards. I didn't know
where you wanted me to put them.
Are you taking any
prescription medication?
That's his way of showing he likes you.But when I touched him before,
he pulled away.
Don't take it personal.
He never touched me.
I'm closer to him than anybody.
Known him for nine years. It's not him.
If I left town tomorrow and
didn't say good-bye, he'd never notice.
He wouldn't notice?
I'm not sure, but I don't think
people are his first priority.
Ray, you wanna go take a walk?
Can he hear us
when he's Like that?
You wanna show
your brother your ducks?
There's 27 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'
Don't worry.
We'll bring you right back.
Practically 26 minutes
to 'Jeopardy.'
- We'll bring him right back.
- Twenty-six minutes.
I won't do it.
First of all because of your
tone of voice, this commanding--
You're upset. Raymond,
I'm gonna talk to Susanna alone.
Susanna, just hold on.
Okay? I'll be right back.
No. Just stay there.
Just stay there.
Just stand still, okay? That's good.
I'll do it if you tell me why.
Why do I do--
What?
Why do I have to take the car
and go down there...
and wait for you again
at the gate?
- Why?
- It's for Raymond.
The car disturbs him.
- That's why?
- That's why.
Okay, Raymond.
What are you lookin' at?
The ducks are over here.
I don't know.
Listen, our father died last week.
- Did they tell you?
- I don't know.
You don't know if they told you,
or you don't know what dead is?
That means he's gone.
He's at the cemetery.
- You wanna go see him at the cemetery?
- I don't know.
- Does that mean maybe you wanna go?
- I don't know.
I thought maybe we could go to
Los Angeles and see a Dodgers game.
- Go see the Dodgers play.
- Today's an off day.
- We don't have to go today.
- Monday, no games scheduled.
I just thought maybe you'd Like
to go see Fernando Valenzuela pitch.
He pitched Saturday.
Not scheduled to pitch 'til Wednesday.- He's gonna pitch Wednesday?
- Wednesday.
- I'm not doin' anything on Wednesday.
- Yeah, Wednesday.
- Let's go to L.A.
- Yeah.
Come on, Ray.
It's a Long way
to California...
and I'm definitely not supposed to be
off the grounds for more than two hours.
Have to be back in two hours.
The people, crowds cheering.
You'll love it.
- This is the presidential suite.
- Dinner's at 6:
30 p.m.
Here is Raymond's room.
- Look at this beautiful room.
- This is definitely not my room.
- It's just for tonight.
- Have to go to Wallbrook for dinner.
Little guy! This is gonna be terrific.
We're brothers.
- Dr. Bruner wants us to have fun.
- When did he say--
I don't have my tapioca pudding.
We have that for dessert.
We can do that.
I'm gonna call Lenny.
This is definitely not my room,
and I don't have my tapioca pudding.
- The bed's in the wrong place.
- You can move it.
- Where do you want the bed?
- Should be near the window.
Of course, I don't have my books.
Of course, there's no bookshelves.
I'm definitely out of books.
I'm gonna be book-less.
Here's a book, a big telephone book.
A lot of words.
Pick up, Lenny.
I got $200,000 going to the shithouse,
and he doesn't answer the phone.
- 6:
00 here means it's 9:00 there.
- It's 3:
00 there.
It's 3:
00 there.
He doesn't wanna answer the phone?
Orange soda.
Has to be in a can with a straw.
Bruner told you
that you should do this?
- It doesn't make sense.
- I know what's good for him.
V-E-R-N!
Oh, God.
Go see what he's doin'.
- Ray?
- V-E-R-N!
- What is it?
- What's happening, homes?
Everything is fine.
Charlie, let's take him home.
He's okay.
Just get him some dinner.
Did you say you wanted hamburger?
Hamburger, Ray?
- We have pepperoni pizza Monday nights.
- Pizza?- You get pizza in the institution?
- Monday night's Italian night.
- Law offices of Mitchell and Mitchell.
- Get me Stu.
- I'm sorry, he's not here.
- I've got a bit of a legal problem.
He's out of town
until tomorrow afternoon.
All right,
I'll call him tomorrow.
- Definitely not.
- We can watch TV here. We're allowed.
'Wheel of Fortune'!
Look at this studio filled with
glamorous merchandise...
fabulous and exciting
bonus prizes.
A pair of cars for today's busy couple.
Thousands of dollars in cash.
Over $150,000
just waiting to be won...
as we present
our big bonanza of cash...
on 'Wheel Of Fortune'!
I'd Like to order a large pizza.
Pepperoni, right?
I don't want pepperoni.
Yeah, a large pepperoni.
How Long is that gonna take?
Bring some beer up and orange soda.
You got tapioca pudding?
- No, sir, we don't.
- Just bring the closest thing.
Ray, take this.
Food is coming shortly.
I'll be right back.
Of course, I'm gonna be here
for a Long time, a very Long time.
I'm gone for good,
gone for good from my home.
- Si! Si!
- Si.
What is that?
I think Raymond is in the room.
- Raymond, are you in here?
- Charlie Babbitt.
Well, get out!
Get out!
- Go!
- Stop it.
- Jesus Christ!
- Go in there with him.
- Charlie, go in there.
- Why?
He's afraid.
He doesn't understand this.
Go in there.
Raymond, what were you doin' in my room?
What were you doin' in my room?
- I don't know.
- You don't know what you were doin'?
-Of course, there were noises.
-Those noises are none of your business.
You understand that?
Stop actin' Like an idiot
and go to sleep.
Did you hear what I said?
Go to sleep!
- Go to sleep!
- It's nine minutes to 11:00.
- Lights out at 11:00.
- Yeah, well, new rules.
You don't listen to me.
- What are you talkin' about?- I asked you to apologize.
- You went there and insulted him again.
- I'm not his mother.
Charlie, you're his brother!
They tell you today
that you have a brother...
and I don't see in your face
one little reaction.
- I'm not saying joy.
- You don't know what I'm goin' through.
What are you going through?
Because I don't know.
You don't tell me anything.
- You just give me lies!
- What lies?
This thing that Dr. Bruner asked you
to bring him here, this is bullshit.
I know it's not true.
So tell me, why is he here?
- I'm pissed at him.
- At who?
- My father.
- So you bring Raymond here. Why?
- 'Cause I got him and they want him!
- This makes no sense!
- Raymond was left all the money.
- How much?
- $3 million. Every penny of it.
- So?
I'm gonna keep him
'til I get my half!
What is this, huh?
Susanna?
- Just take it easy.
- I've had enough.
- What does that mean?
- I'm leaving.
You're leaving me now?
I need you!
You need nobody.
What does that mean?
Just take it easy!
What is my crime here?
Your crime is
that you use people!
- You're using Raymond, you're using me.
- I'm using Raymond?
Raymond, am I using you?
Shut up! He is answering a question
from a half hour ago!
What good is $3 million to him?
That money is only gonna sit there,
and I need that money.
You need it, so it's not Like stealing.
And then what happens to Raymond?
He'll go back to Wallbrook,
or I'll put him in a better place.
- He is gonna be just the same.
- Only you have his money.
His money? That man was my father too.
Where's my fuckin' half?
- I'm entitled to that money!
- You kidnapped this man!
I did not take him.
I took my half.
- Charlie, you're crazy.
- It runs in the family.
You're soaking wet and you're gonnaLeave in the middle of the night. Wait.
My father stuck it to me all my Life.
What do you want from me?
I want out.
- Stop that.
- Good morning.
- Coffee?
- That'd be good.
Dibbs, Sally.
How did you know
my phone number?
How'd you know that?
You said read the telephone book.
Dibbs, Sally. 461-0192.
He remembers things,
little things, sometimes.
Very clever, boys.
I'll be right back.
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.
Did you memorize the whole book?
- How far did you get?
- 'G.'
'G.' Gottsaken, William Marshall.
- You memorized to 'G'?
- Yeah, 'G.'
- A, B, C, D, E, F, G?
- Half of 'G.'
That's good, Ray.
I Like that.
- You hungry?
- Tuesday we have pancakes.
- That sounds good.
- Maple syrup.
- You bet your butt.
- Bet your butt.
They got pancakes.
- What is this, Ray?
- I don't have my toothpicks.
You don't need toothpicks.
That was okay in the hotel with pizza,
but in a restaurant you use a fork.
- I don't have my toothpicks.
- You don't need toothpicks.
The pancakes
will keep sliding off.
I don't have my maple syrup either.
I'm gonna be without my maple syrup.
You don't see any pancakes,
do you?
Of course,
maple syrup is not here.
Ray, when we order the pancakes,
they're gonna bring the maple syrup.
Maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pancakes.
We haven't ordered yet.
Maple syrup after the pancakes
is definitely too late.
How is that gonna be too late?
We haven't ordered the pancakes yet.
If we're gonna be here all morning
with no maple syrup and no toothpicks...
I'm definitely not gonna
have my pancakes with--
Don't make a scene.
Stop actin' Like a fuckin' retard.
What are you writing?
What the f*ck is this?
'Serious'-- 'Serious injury list:
Charlie Babbitt'?
'Serious injury list'?Are you fuckin' kidding me?
Number 18 in 1988.
Squeezed and pulled
and hurt my neck in 1988.
'Squeezed and pulled and hurt
your neck in 1988'?
Dr. Bruner, it's Charlie Babbitt.
Where are you, son?
That's not important.
What matters is who I'm with.
You have to bring him back,
Mr. Babbitt. Do you understand me?
No problem.
That will be $1.5 million.
I'm not greedy. I just want my half.
Don't touch that.
I can't do that, Mr. Babbitt.
You know I can't.
Just bring him back,
and bring him back now.
He belongs here.
I'm his brother.
It's not Like kidnapping here, is it?
He's always been a voluntary patient
here, but that's beside the point.
This is where he can get
the best care.
We're talking about his well-being.
Yeah. Let's just cut through
the bullshit, okay?
I am entitled to part
of my father's estate.
If you won't cut a deal with me,
I'll fly him back to Los Angeles...
I'll stick him in an institution
out there...
and we can have
a custody battle over him.
Miss, he needs toothpicks.
Could you get him some?
Thank you.
Now, you wanna battle me
in the courts?
You think about that, Dr. Bruner.
Think about that.
Or we can cut a deal right now.
I don't think you have any idea
of the severity of Raymond's condition.
Toothpicks. He needs toothpicks.
Can we just get him
some toothpicks?
I cannot make
money deals with you.
Then I'll see you in court.
Can I have the check?
Sorry about the toothpicks.
- How much is this?
- Toothpicks.
That's more than 82 toothpicks.
Keep the change.
How many toothpicks are in there?
- 250.
- Pretty close. Let's go, Ray.
There's four left in the box.
I have to get my backpack.
The future of rock and roll.
The future of rock and roll.
The future of rock and roll.
The future of rock and roll.Ray.
Enough already.
Change the channel.
The future of rock and roll.
Lenny, I don't care what you think.
Did they say that?
You're gonna have to be
more forceful with them.
Lenny, are you--
Lenny, shut up a moment.
I am in serious trouble.
I can't get to these cars.
I can't get the money.
Do you understand that?
- My Loan is past due.

tell him we have
a little problem.
- Listen, Charlie, let me talk--
- Lenny, just listen to me.
I'll be in LAX
in three hours, okay?
Now, remember, the Buick

- Airline travel's very dangerous.
- Don't be silly.
It's the safest travel in the world.
You'll love this. Trust me.
Now come on.
We're in an airport.
People fly out of airports.
- Why do you think we're here?
- Flying's very dangerous.
In 1987, there were
and 230 were definitely passengers.
This plane is very safe.
Believe me.
I gotta get to L.A.
I don't have time for this shit.
Oh, I don't know. I don't know.
- You don't know?
- No.
- Is it this airline?
- Yeah.
Okay, fine. We can--
There's an American plane.
American flight 625...
crashed April 27, 1976.
We don't have to take American.
There's a lot of flights.
Pick another airline.

Lockheed L-1011.
Dallas-Fort Worth.
Terrible wind shear.
- All airlines--

All airlines have crashed

That doesn't mean
that they are not safe.
- Quantas.
- Quantas?
Quantas never crashed.
- Quantas?
- Never crashed.
- Well, that's--
- Never crashed.
That's gonna do me
a lot of good.
Quantas doesn't fly to L.A.
out of Cincinnati.
- You have got to get to Melbourne...
- Australia.
in order to get the plane
that flies to Los Angeles.
- Do you hear me?
- Canberra's the capital.

What? I hear ya! I hear ya!
- Memorial Hospital is ready--
- Stay in your car!
What's it gonna be, Ray?
This is
a very dangerous highway.
How will I get to L.A.?
Driving a car on this interstate
is very dangerous.
You wanna get off the highway?
Will that make you happy?
- Yeah.
- Well, you gotta get in the car...
in order to get off the highway!
In 1986, 46,400 male drivers
were involved in fatal accidents.
I got a great idea.
You'll stay in front of the car
until we get off the exit.
You'll get in, and we'll take
the not-so-dangerous road.
- Is that an idea?
- Yeah.
Give me five, Ray.
That's a great idea.
Give me five. Yeah.
This guy's a fuckin' fruitcake.
I'm asking you. Who's on first?
That's the man's name.
That's whose name? Yes.
Go ahead and tell me.
Who? The guy on first.
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.
Whose wife? Yes.
- After all, the man earns it.

Absolutely.
All I'm tryin' to find out
is what the guy's name on first base.No, what is on second base.
I'm not asking you who's on second base?
Who's on first?

Forget it.
This is a good one.
'We don't go out when it rains.'
This is a good one.
I hope you appreciate this...
because my business
is going down the toilet.
I should be in L.A.
Instead I'm in the Honeymoon Haven Motel
in Bumblefuck, Missouri...
because you won't
go out when it rains.
It's mystifying. It really is.
Fuckin' mystifying.
What is this?
Good news, bad news?
We passed D.O.T.
but failed E.P.A. again.
It all ends up the same.
I can't get my money.
Well, yes, sir. I'm just stuck
in Cincinnati since the funeral.
So many leftover details.
My family is...
needless to say,
quite overwhelmed.
Yeah, well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
It is a shock, to say the least.
Thank you. Can I get
an extension on that Loan?
A couple of days
would make a big difference.
'We don't go out when it's raining.'

Legally, Bruner never established
a conservatorship of Raymond?
He didn't figure anyone would show up
to contest his authority.
If that's the case,
I definitely will get custody...
and the $3 million, right?
And you set up a date-- Yeah, you set up
a date for the custody hearing.
Stu, I want a firm date,
and I want it early.
I found that it wasn't
an original record...
because the original song
had two verses--
She hasn't come in?
She hasn't called?
If you hear from her, tell her
to call me at this number.
The Air Alpha Force,
from Nike.
Look at that.
under that hood.
- It's beautiful.
- 'Course, I'm an excellent driver.
- You know how to drive?
- Yeah.
When did you drive?
I drove the Buick on the driveway
when my dad came to Wallbrook.
Was Dad in the car, Ray?
Yeah.

- Yeah, slow on the driveway.
We'll have to let you
drive sometime.
You never touch this steering wheelwhen I'm driving! Do you hear me?
- Yeah.

- I don't have my underwear.
- What?
I'm definitely not wearing
my underwear.

I told you to put 'em on.
Where are they?
They're in the pocket of my jacket.
- Where?
- Here.
- These are too tight.
- I don't want them back.
- Mine are boxer shorts.
- What's the difference?
- These are Hanes 32.
- Underwear is underwear.
My boxer shorts have my name.
It says 'Raymond.'

we'll pick up some boxer shorts.
I get my boxer shorts

- You don't fool me.
Yours are too tight.
Did you fuckin' hear what I said?
Shut up!
Cincinnati's a Long way off.
You're getting further away
from Kmart.
You don't have to go to Cincinnati
to get underwear at Kmart.
You have to go to Kmart,
We are not going to Cincinnati,
and that's final.
- Get my boxer shorts at Kmart.

I'm goin' out of my mind!
What difference does it make
where you buy underwear?
What difference does it make?
Underwear is underwear!
It is underwear wherever you buy it,

You put your shorts
on the highway.

Good luck finding
a shrink in this town.
Raymond?
Hey, you.
Dipshit, move it!
If you ain't gonna move,
I'll move you.

and this is the way
our country developed...
from the East Coast
to the West Coast.
During that period of time...
there was initiated...
what was known as
the Pony Express.
I'm sure you have read something about
it in the history of the United States.
I may not have the days
or the years exactly right...
but I'm more or less familiar
with the history of the United States.
- I love to tell the story--
- He's 'artistic'?
No, he's autistic.
I'm not familiar with that.
What is the exact nature
of the problem?
...in St. Joe's, Missouri--
He lives in a world of his own.
I'm sorry,
but what's wrong with him?
It was a problem gettin' mail
from the East Coast--
-Raymond, do 'What's On First?' for her.
-Who's on first. What's on second.
They set up an initial program...
where the Pony Express...
would ride for approximately
What am I supposed to do?
There's gotta be something
that I can do here.
Well, I'm not a psychiatrist...
but I do know his brain doesn't workLike other people.
What he does
isn't intended to be annoying.
If he's gettin' on your nerves,
take a break.
- Spend time away from him.
- I'll just send him back.
- Sorry?
- Nothing.
Inside joke. You're telling me
I just have to deal with this?
I just gotta deal with it.
Yeah, that's about it.
Out of curiosity, does he have
any special abilities?
Well, he's got
a pretty good memory.
He counts toothpicks.
They spilled a box of toothpicks
on the floor...
and he took one look and knew
exactly how many there were.

how much money
would you have left?
About 70.

True, he didn't have his shirt on--
the other one did--

didn't burn or got real cold--
- I put my hand on the dry ice.
- Daddy's not here now.
I wanted to take it off quickly

It's just another motel.

That's the man's name.
That's whose name.
What are you asking me for?
I'm not asking you. I'm telling you.
Who is on first.
I'm asking you, who's on first?
- Yo, Ray.

- This is not a riddle.
- Yeah. Know the fella's name?
-Yeah. Then who's playing first base?
-You'll never figure out who's on first.
Who is on first.
That's the joke. It's comedy.
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.
- Whose wife?
- It's comedy.
Every dollar of it. Yeah.
You got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.
It's a routine
between Abbott and Costello.
When you do it, you're not funny.
You're Abbott and Abbott.

Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.Whose wife? Yeah.
- Ray?
- Yeah.
- You are never gonna solve it.
- Yeah.
You know why?
It's not a riddle.
And if you understood that...
if you understood that it's funny,
you might get better.
All I'm trying to find out
is what's the guy's name on first base.
What's the guy's name on first base? No,
what's the guy's name on second base.
Have you got a first baseman
on first? Yeah.
Then who's playing first?

I see it.
I see it.
What's that?
Will you stop for a second?
I see it.
Put that down.
I'm trying to talk to you.
When I say stop it,
why don't you stop it?
Why do you always have to act
Like an idiot?
- Yeah.
- You think that's funny?
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Funny teeth.
- What'd you say?
- Funny teeth.
Rinse.
Why'd you say--
Why'd you say funny teeth?
You said funny teeth,

'Rain man'?
I said, 'Rain man'?
Yeah, funny Rain Man.
Was I trying to say 'Raymond'
and it came out 'rain man'?
Yeah. Funny Rain Man.
You? You're the rain man?- Who took this picture?
- D-a-d.
- You lived with us?
- Yeah, 10961 Beechcrest Street...
Cincinnati, Ohio.
When did you Leave?
January 21, 1965.
- You remember then?
- It was Thursday. Very snowy out.
- Just after Mom died. New Year's.
- Yeah, Mom died.
January 5, 1965.
And you remember that day
that you left?
- Short and sudden illness.
- You remember that day you left?
Was I there? Where was l?
You were in the window.
You waved to me.
'Bye-bye, Rain Man.
Bye-bye, Rain Man.'
So, you--
- You were the one that sang to me?
- Yeah.
What did you sing?
What was that song?
What did you sing?
She was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
was way beyond compare
So how could I dance
with another
When I saw her standing there
Did I Like it
when you sang to me?
Did we sing any other songs
Like the Beatles?
Scary! Hot! Scary bad!
Scary bad! Scary!
What's scary about it?
Hot water burn baby!
- Water!
- 'Hot water burn baby'?
- What baby? Me?
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

Look at me, please.

Hot water burn--
Tub burn baby.

- Tub burn baby.
- I'm not burned.
- Yeah.
I'm not burned. It's okay.
It's okay.
Time for Wallbrook now.
That's why they put you away.
They thought you'd hurt me.
Never hurt baby.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie.
What? What?
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
What, Ray?
What?
Come on. It's 11:00, Ray.
- Lights out.
- Yeah.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
Never hurt Charlie Babbitt.
There you go. Right where you Like 'em,
at the end of the bed.
Come on, Ray.
Hi, it's me.
You didn't hang up.
Does that mean we're engaged?
Listen, l, uh--I just wanna hear it's not over.
I'm scared it's over.
Don't ask me tonight.
I don't know what to say.
- Let it sit.
- Something I'm not real good at.
There are a lot of things
that you're not good at.
I'll call you
when I get back, okay?
- I'll see you.
- Ciao.
Why are you looking at that? I bought
a TV, and you're watching a dryer.
I don't know.
Because at the shrink hearing,
we'll have to prove...
you prefer to watch TV as opposed to
the clothes dryer, you understand that?
- Yeah.
- You Listening to me?
Turn this off
when you're not watching it.
- Yeah.
- You'll run down the batteries.
Then where will you be
at 3:
00 when Wapner's on?
Yeah. The red one
always falls the same.
Why don't you listen to me?
You don't wanna
listen to me, do you?
You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
I gotta make
a phone call.
Lenny, it's me.
Where have you been? I've been
sittin' by this phone for three hours.
I had to buy some clothes.
Clothes? Charlie, we are
in serious trouble.
- Why are you buyin' clothes?
- Take it easy.
I'm in Tucumcari.
I'll be there--
They repossessed the cars
to pay off the Loan.
The cars are gone, Charlie.
And Bateman wants
his down payment back. They all do.
That's 80,000, Charlie.
You gotta pay these people back,
or it's all over.
We're out of business.
What am I gonna tell 'em?
I don't know.
Son of a bitch!
Son of a bitch!
This would be easier
if you let me put the top up.
You wouldn't have to fry.
Put this lotion on
so you don't burn.
Don't start with that.
You want me to put the top up?
- I definitely Like the top down.
- I know. I don't want you to burn.
Definitely Like it
when the top's--
It's all right.
Just take it easy.
- Oh, no.
- It's almost over.
Uh-huh. All right.
How does that feel?Very slippery.
Maldonado swings, and there's
a base hit into center field.
One run is in.
Here's Brenly going to third.
The throw by Davis... not in time.
Brenly in safely
at third base...
on Maldonado's single.
He held that ball too Long
in center field, don't you think so?
We'll look at it again.
Treadwell playing way over towards
the right side, shaded him to pull.
Here's Davis.
Yeah, he seems to hold it there
just a bit, Tom.
Sort of double-pumped it.
Watch the replay.
He loses all chance
on a play on Brenly...
even though Brenly
doesn't exactly run fast.
And the throw into third base
finally is a little bit high.
Will you give me
a break with this?
Ray, stop it.
J-7.
- K-7? What's that?
- J-7.
What's J-7?
What's J-7? The song?
Look out there, Raymond.
No, out here.

One 5.
You are beautiful, man.
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You can't drive now, Ray.
You Listening to me?
This is very important.
When there's lots of tens and picture
cards left, then it's good for us.
- Say it. 'Tens are good.'
- Tens are good.
- Okay. And you're gonna bet one--
- One if it's bad.
- Two if it's good.
- That's right. Two if it's good.
Now, listen.
Casinos have house rules.
The first one is,
they don't Like to lose.So you never, never show
that you are counting cards.
That is the cardinal sin, Ray.
Are you Listening to me?
That's very, very important.
Yeah. Counting is bad.
Yes. Counting is bad.
I Like to drive
slow on the driveway.
You get this right, you can drive
wherever you want as slow as you Like.
I'm an excellent driver.

You are Mr. Las Vegas now.
What do you think?
There's a lot of lights out there.

We made a lot of money today.
Forgetting the $3,000 that we
tossed away at that wheel of fortune.
Yeah, 'Wheel Of Fortune.'
And I'm sorry about that.
I got a little carried away.
I got a little hot, Ray.

I'm the date, so you want to--
You wanna put your
left hand up Like this.
Raymond, don't stop movin'.
Payin' attention?

- Yeah, I know. Come on in.
I'm glad to see you.
Ray, look who's here.
It's not right,
what you're doing to Raymond.
- He's fine.
- I know he's fine.
He's in Las Vegas in a suit
in a big room. It makes me sad.
Six minutes to my date.
Six minutes to Iris.
He has a date?
Raymond, it'd be nice if you didn't
carry that television everywhere we go.
Why do you have to bring
a Watchman on your date?
A man's dancing.
But what does your date
look Like, Raymond?
She's very sparkly.
She looks Like a holiday.
- I haven't heard that one before.

He's director of security.
Would you come with me, please?
Sure. Susanna,
you stay with Raymond.
- Right this way.
- Certainly.
She'll come. She will.
Congratulations, Mr. Babbitt.
Counting into a six-deck shoe is a feat.
I don't understand
what you're talking about.
We make videotapes, Mr. Babbitt,
and we analyze the tapes...
and we even share some of the
information with the other casinos.
These tapes suggest that you should
take your winnings and Leave the state.Someone has a good day
at the tables...
and you accuse them
of illegal activities?
Is this how you treat
all your guests?
All you have to do is
close your mouth and go home.
Those are the best odds you're
gonna see for a while. I'd take 'em.
- Did you want to dance on your date?
- Yeah.
There'll be other chances. Many pretty
girls would love to dance with you.
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be okay.
- I Like this music, Ray.
- Elevator stopped.
It's okay. You think you could show me
how you were going to dance with Iris?
- Yeah.
- Yes?
- Would you Like to dance with me?
- Elevator's on hold.
- Give me this.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
- Show me how.
Charlie Babbitt taught me.
- Charlie Babbitt?
- Yeah.
Dancing in the elevator.
It's nice.
You're very good.
- Iris missed a beautiful dance.
- Yeah.
- And a kiss.
- Yeah, a kiss.
- Have you ever kissed a girl?
- I don't know.
You don't know?
Open your mouth. Open.
- Yeah.
- Like this.
Like you were tasting
something very good...
and very soft.
Like this.
Close your eyes.
- It's okay, Ray.
- Yeah.
- How was that?
- Wet.
- Then we did it right.
- Elevator's definitely stuck.
No, it's not stuck.
Here.
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
- Like us.
- Yeah, Like us.
What'd I tell you, Ray?
I promised you could drive.
- At Wallbrook, I drive on the driveway.
- Charlie, this is okay?
- I'm an excellent driver.
- He's good on a driveway.
Ray, why don't you
get in the front seat?
So, I'll wait to hear from you
after Raymond's meeting?
- Yeah.
- It's gonna be fine.
- Yeah. I'm nervous.
- I know.
Listen, I'm glad, happy--
I'm happy that you came to Vegas.
I know.
Ciao.
Ray, thank you for the date
in the elevator. It was really nice.
- Yeah.
- Ciao.- Thank you for the what?
- It's something between us.
- Between us?
- Us.
Us, Ray?
Here we go, Ray.
This is your bedroom up here.
Of course, there's
definitely no bed there.
No, this is a magic bed, Ray.
You just watch and see.
We got the table over here.
We got the television, Ray.
Went to the video store.
Got a surprise for you, Ray.
Picked up a video for you.
Don't start with that, Ray.
It's not just another place, Ray.
This is my place.
I'm asking you who's on first.
That's the man's name.
Who? The first baseman.
Who is on first.
You got a first baseman on first?
Certainly. Then who's playing first?
- The man's entitled to it.
- Who is?
Yes.
- So who gets it?
- Why shouldn't he?
Sometimes his wife
comes down and collects it.
- Whose wife?
- Yes.
- After all, the man earns it.
- Who does?
Absolutely.
All I'm tryin' to find out is
what's the guy's name on first base?
No, What is on second base.
- Don't you think this is funny?
- Yes, it's funny.
- Where'd you see this first?
- Dad gave me a book on baseball trivia.
- Dad, huh?
- Yeah.
- Guess it didn't read as funny.
- Definitely not.
Hello, this is Dr. Bruner.
I'd Like you to call me.
Yeah, what is it?
I thought I got the machine.
I just got into town, and the
psychological interview is tomorrow.
Yes, sir, I know that.
I thought we should
get together and talk.
I think it might be in your
best interests to meet me.
When?
I'm at the Bonaventure.
How about tonight at 8:30?
Tomorrow you'll meet Dr. Marston,
who's in charge of Raymond's evaluation.
- Yeah, I know.
- I gave him boxes of files on Raymond.
- Good luck.
- This isn't a close call.
It's a formality. Your brother's
a very disabled individual.
Are you trying to tell me that
Marston's gonna rule against me?No, I'm telling you
it's always been a lost cause.
- Then why did you call me?
- Let me tell you something.
Your father put me in charge
of all the money.
It doesn't matter whether or not
you win custody of Raymond.
I won't have to pay you a dime.
It's at my discretion.
- So you can't lose?
- I can lose Raymond.
I care about your brother's Life
and the treatment he receives.
I made a commitment to your father
some 20 years ago...
and I'm not willing
to gamble with that.
What is this?
It's a very big check.
$250,000.
And no strings attached.
Just walk away, Charlie.
This isn't about you and me.
It's not about winning or losing.
I asked you a week ago, why didn't
anyone ever tell me I had a brother?
You didn't have an answer.
I don't know.
I just realized
I'm not pissed off anymore...
my father cut me out of his will.
You probably knew he tried
to contact me over the years.
I never called him back.
I was a prick.
If he was my son and didn't return
my calls, I'd have written him out.
But it's not about
the money anymore.
You know,
I just don't understand.
Why didn't he tell me
I had a brother?
Why didn't anyone ever tell me
that I had a brother?
Because it'd have been nice to know him
for more than just the past six days.
Ray! Come on.
It stopped.
It's all right.

My main man, Vern.

My main man, Vern.

They got raspberry, blueberry...
whole wheat, peachy keen,
beer nut, rocky road, buckwheat.
How about buckwheat?
What kind of pancakes you want, Ray?
- Pancakes.
- What kind?
- Pancakes.
- Of course.
The maple syrup is supposed to be
on the table before the pan--
Charlie Babbitt made a joke.
- I made a joke, Ray.
- Yeah.
Step back a little bit.Hello?
Why don't you go
sit down over there?
Hello?
This is not a legal proceeding,
so there's no judge present...
just the people
who care about Raymond.
Raymond, have a seat over there.
Mr. Babbitt, other side of the table.
Raymond, right here.
How about this seat?
- Take this seat.
- Put your knapsack on the floor.
This is a good opportunity
to be honest with one another.
Ray, the TV?
On the floor. I'm sorry.
I don't know an easy way
to say this, Mr. Babbitt--
Have I lost already?
No, you haven't lost.
I'm not the judge and jury.
I'm just making
a recommendation to a court.
I must tell you that Dr. Bruner
is a very respected professional.
Raymond's case has been meticulously
documented over the years...
and Wallbrook is one of the
finest institutions in this country.
You've made up your mind.
I'll see you in court.
My brother came further with me
than he did with you in 20 years.
- It's not necessary to--
- You don't know anything about us.
- It's not necessary to challenge him.
- I'm sorry.
Exactly what happened
this past week, Raymond?
- We got to know each other.
- I was asking Raymond.
Raymond, what happened
this past week?
- What did you do?
- Counted cards.
- Counted cards?
- Counted cards in Las Vegas.
- Your brother took you to Las Vegas?
- Lost $3,000 on the wheel of fortune.
Gave you $3,000 to gamble with?
Lost $3,000 on pitiful 20.
- And what else did you do?
- Bet on number 20.
- What else did you do?
- Danced with Charlie Babbitt.
- Danced with your brother?
- He wanted to learn.
Danced in the elevator with Susanna.
Kissed Susanna.
- You kissed Susanna?
- Yeah, in the elevator.
- Did you enjoy kissing a woman?
- I don't know.
- How did it feel?
- It felt wet.
- Wet?
- Yeah.- Quite a trip, huh?
- Yeah.
- Did you enjoy being on the road?
- I'm an excellent driver.
- You drove?
- Yeah.
-Your brother let you drive the highway?
-Slow on the driveway.
He didn't drive on the highway.
- Did he have any emotional outbursts?
- What do you mean?
Well, things they tend to do when--
Inflict bodily harm on themselves.
- Yeah, a couple of times.
- A couple of times?
He had what you call an outburst at
the airport because he didn't wanna fly.
- So we didn't fly.
- When was his last outburst?
- This morning when--
- This morning?
This is bullshit, because I could
tell you anything or tell you nothing.
You'd never know the difference.
This morning the smoke alarm went off.
He got nervous,
but he's fine now.
Don't feel as I'm
placing any blame.
We went out for pancakes.
He's fine.
- You don't have to be defensive.
- I'm just being honest with you.
- You're missing the point.
- I'm being truthful about this.
I'm not placing any blame--
I had a father I hardly knew,
a mother I didn't know at all.
I find out now that I have a brother,
and I'm supposed to give him up?
No one is saying anything.
I didn't hurt him, he's not hurting me,
we're not hurting you.
- Why are you interfering?
- I'm not interfering.
- This is my family.
- I understand that.
Your brother is not capable
of having a relationship with you.
That's your opinion. Did you spend 24
hours a day, seven days a week with him?
You cannot care for your brother
without professional guidance.
- That's your opinion.
- Yes, it's my opinion.
There's some things
I'd Like to go over.
Dr. Bruner states a week ago you
stole Raymond out of the institution...
and were willing to trade him
for $1.5 million, correct?
My father died.
I was upset.
That was wrong.Last week you were upset, and this week
you've found a devotion to him...
and you want to
take care of him.
Yes.
From the beginning
it was Like a kidnapping.
Kidnapping. That's very strong.
I didn't kidnap my brother.
But in the course of a week, you came
to have an understanding with him.
Yes.
- Look, that--
- Yes?
I understand that this sounds
irrational to you.
When it started out--
- Don't feel compelled to be defensive.
- Can I talk?
- Yes, you can.
- Thank you.
There's no accusations.
Go ahead.
No accusations?
See, you have to understand...
that when we started out together
that he was only my brother...
in name.
And then...
this morning we had pancakes.
Maple syrup.
Maple syrup on the--
Maple syrup on the table.
And Charlie Babbitt made a joke.
See, we--
I made a connection.
I think it's admirable
that you made a connection...
but the purpose of this meeting is to
determine what is best for Raymond...
whether or not he's capable
of functioning in the community...
and what, in fact, he wants,
if that's possible to determine.
I'm all for that.
- Raymond's unable to make decisions.
- You're wrong.
He can't decide for himself.
He's capable
of a lot more than you know.
Why don't we ask Raymond?
Raymond, can I ask you
a few questions?
- The doctor's talking to you.
- Can I ask you a few questions?
Do you wanna stay
with your brother?
Raymond, would you Like to stay
with your brother in Los Angeles?
The doctor's asking you a question.
- So you listen.
- Yeah.
Raymond, do you wanna stay
with your brother Charlie?
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.
- You do?
- Yeah.
You wanna stay with your brother?
Yeah. I wanna stay with
my brother Charlie Babbitt.
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.- You wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.
- Can I ask you something else?
- Yeah.
- You wanna go back to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.
Raymond, can you make a distinction
between your brother and Wallbrook?
Yeah.
- Do you wanna stay with your brother?
- Yeah.
- Or do you wanna go to Wallbrook?
- Yeah.
They're two separate things.
Your brother or Wallbrook?
It's not one thing, Raymond.
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Okay.
- Back to Wallbrook, stay with Charlie.
- Can you make that choice?
- One or the other.
- Go back to Wallbrook.
All right.
Just hold on here.
All right.
All right.
You made your point.
You don't have to humiliate him.
Ray, it's okay.
- It's over.
- Yeah.
Stay back at Wallbrook
with Charlie Babbitt.
- Stay back at Wallbrook--
- It's over.
- Raymond?
- Yeah.
Dr. Bruner, can I talk to you?
Excuse me.
- You okay, Ray?
- Yeah.
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.
I don't know.
- You don't want more questions, do you?
- No.
- There won't be any more questions.
- Yeah.
- I'll make sure of that.
- Yeah, main man.
- What?
- My main man.
Listen.
Ray, I don't know if I'm gonna
have a chance to talk to you again.
Because you see, these--
Dr. Bruner really likes you a lot,
and he's probably gonna take you back.
- You know?
- Yeah.
What I said about being
on the road with you I meant.
Connecting.
- I Like having you for my brother.
- I'm an excellent driver.
Yes, you are.
I Like having you
for my big brother.
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.
C-H-A-R-L-l-E.
Main man.
May I have your attention, please?
Amtrak train number 36,
the Desert Wind, eastbound...
now boarding, track number three.
- Fullerton, San Bernardino, Barstow...
- Ray.
Las Vegas, Salt Lake City,
Denver, Omaha, Chicago.
- Hello, Charlie.- Dr. Bruner.
Hello, Raymond.
Wouldn't you feel more relaxed
in your favorite Kmart clothes?
Tell him, Ray.
- Kmart sucks.
- I see.
I have the tickets, and I'll be on
this car right here to the right.
Why don't you take a couple of minutes?
See you, Charlie.
You made a joke, Ray.
I guess I'd better give this to you.
You're gonna have to carry this now.
It's got your cheeseballs,
your apple juice...
notebooks, pens and...
'Who's On First?' video
that you Like.
- 'Who's On First?' is very funny.
- I told you it's funny.
Board!
- Better get goin'.
- Very shiny train.
Yeah, it sure is.
Now listen, Ray.
Dr. Bruner only has custody of you.
That doesn't mean I can't visit.
I'm comin' to see you in two weeks.
- How many days is that?
- Fourteen days from today.
- Today's Wednesday.
- And hours?
Mystifying.
'Course, that's 20,160 minutes.
Ray?
I'll see you soon.
Yeah.
One for bad, two for good.
Bet two for good.
Three minutes to Wapner.
You'll make it.
