               The CAPITOL DOME at Washington fades in. It is night, and 
               the dome is flooded in light.

               This view dissolves to the exterior of a Newspaper Office 
               WINDOW, seen at night. The letters on the window, illuminated 
               by a street light, are picked out with increasing 
               distinctness. They read: WASHINGTON POST-DISPATCH. This 
               dissolves into the NIGHT CITY EDITOR'S OFFICE, where a 
               lethargic, eyeshaded man behind a desk reaches for the 
               telephone which is ringing.

                                     EDITOR
                              (mechanically)
                         Desk--
                              (Then, perking up)
                         What?

               Inside a PHONE BOOTH in a Hospital Corridor, where a nurse 
               seated at the corridor desk is visible through the glass 
               doors of the booth, a man is telephoning:

                                     REPORTER
                         Senator Samuel Foley--dead. Died a 
                         minute ago--here at St. Vincent's. 
                         At the bedside was state political 
                         sidekick, Senator Joseph Paine--

               And we see the HOSPITAL OFFICE where Senator Joseph Paine, a 
               trim, rather dignified man of fifty-eight, occupying the 
               desk of the nurse who stands by, is talking rapidly and 
               agitatedly into a phone.

                                     PAINE
                              (into the phone)
                         Long distance? Senator Joseph Paine 
                         speaking. I want the Governor's 
                         residence at Jackson City--Governor 
                         Hubert Hopper. Hurry--

               The scene dissolves into a skimming view of TELEPHONE WIRES 
               strung over a vast distance--and then into the BEDROOM of 
               Governor and Mrs. Hopper, where the Governor and his wife 
               are found in their twin beds, the room darkened. The buzzer 
               is sounding. Mrs. Emma Hopper, wife of the Governor, sits 
               bolt upright in the dark.

                                     EMMA
                              (a shrew)
                         I knew it! I knew a night's rest 
                         wasn't possible in this house!
                              (As the buzzer is 
                              heard again)
                         Hubert!

                                     HUBERT
                              (waking with a start, 
                              bewildered)
                         Wha--? Yes, sweetheart-- Wha--?

                                     EMMA
                         That infernal phone!

                                     HUBERT
                         Yes, yes--phone, phone--
                              (Fumbling for the 
                              light)
                         A--an outrage, pet--an outrage--I'll 
                         look into this--
                              (Seizing the phone)
                         Hello--Joe!--What!--No! Not really! 
                         Terrible!

                                     EMMA
                         What is it?

               In the HOSPITAL ROOM, we see Paine on the phone.

                                     PAINE
                         It couldn't have come at a worse 
                         time. Call Jim Taylor. Tell him I'm 
                         taking a plane tonight for home.

               In GOVERNOR HOPPER'S BEDROOM:

                                     HUBERT
                              (on the phone)
                         Yes, Joe, yes--right away.
                              (He hangs up--then 
                              lifts the receiver 
                              again and begins to 
                              dial)

                                     EMMA
                         What is it?

                                     HUBERT
                         Sam Foley--dead!

                                     EMMA
                         Great saints!

                                     HUBERT
                         Of all the times! Of all the times! 
                         Two months to the end of his term--
                         and Foley has to go and die on us--

                                     EMMA
                         Whom are you calling--in the dead of 
                         night?

                                     HUBERT
                         Taylor, my dear.

                                     EMMA
                         Can't that wait, Hubert?

                                     HUBERT
                         No, no--believe me, pet--this is 
                         *most* urgent--
                              (Into the phone)
                         Hello, hello. Is Taylor there?--
                         Governor Hopper. Quickly, please--

                                     EMMA
                         This isn't a home, it's the crossroads 
                         of the world!

                                     HUBERT
                         Now, now, Emma, dear--you mustn't 
                         forget we have been chosen by the 
                         people of this commonwealth to--

                                     EMMA
                              (sharply)
                         Save that for the laying of 
                         cornerstones, Hubert!
                              (Groaning)
                         Oh, that morning you looked in the 
                         mirror and saw a statesman!

                                     HUBERT
                         Now, pet--
                              (Then, excitedly into 
                              the phone)
                         Jim!

               In political boss TAYLOR'S ROOM, we see JIM TAYLOR, a hard-
               bitten, taciturn, impressive man in his fifties. At the 
               moment, he stands at a phone, in vest and rolled up sleeves, 
               a cigar between his fingers. Behind him, in a smoke-filled 
               room, man are seated at a card table from which Taylor 
               evidently has just risen.

                                     TAYLOR
                         What's up, Happy?

               In HOPPER'S BEDROOM:

                                     HUBERT
                         Sam Foley--died tonight in Washington. 
                         Joe just called. Can you imagine 
                         anything more--?

               In TAYLOR'S ROOM:

                                     TAYLOR
                         Died, huh? Well, take it easy, Happy. 
                         Is Paine coming?--Good. Keep your 
                         shirt on--and your mouth shut. No 
                         statements.

               In HOPPER'S BEDROOM:

                                     HUBERT
                              (into the phone)
                         Y-yes, Jim--Yes--

               And now flashing on the screen are NEWSPAPER HEADLINES of 
               the following morning--announcing Foley's death--and finally 
               such headlines as:

                                    SUCCESSOR TO FOLEY
                                 TO BE NAMED BY GOVERNOR

                                 APPOINTEE WILL FILL OUT
                               UNEXPIRED TERM OF TWO MONTHS

                                     HOPPER'S CHOICE
                                 FOR VACANT SENATE CHAIR
                                     EAGERLY AWAITED

               The scene dissolves into the GOVERNOR'S OUTER OFFICE, in the 
               morning. The office is full of people--newspapermen--dignified 
               citizens--women--all waiting to see the Governor. A group is 
               collected around the male secretary's desk. Two other desks 
               are seen with secretaries at them. There is an undertone of 
               talk.

                                     REPORTER
                         If His Excellency's statement is 
                         going to make the noon edition--

                                     SECRETARY
                         Governor Hopper said you would have 
                         it any minute--

               An austere gent named Edwards pushes toward the desk.

                                     EDWARDS
                              (firmly)
                         Will you please remind the Governor 
                         again--

                                     SECRETARY
                         He know your committee is waiting, 
                         Mr. Edwards.
                              (Raising his voice 
                              over the room)
                         The Governor will see *all* committees 
                         at the first opportunity.

               In the GOVERNOR'S PRIVATE OFFICE we see Hubert Hopper and 
               McGann, the former on the dictagraph, while McGann lounges 
               in a chair.

                                     HUBERT
                              (into the dictagraph)
                         Yes, yes--tell them I'll see them 
                         immediately--immediately!
                              (Snapping up the 
                              dictagraph, turning 
                              wildly on McGann)
                         I can't hold them off! They want 
                         something to say about this 
                         appointment. Ten to one they've got 
                         a man.

                                     MCGANN
                         Relax, Happy. Jim said to wait.

                                     HUBERT
                         I *can't* wait, McGann! You go into 
                         that room and tell Jim Taylor and 
                         Joe Paine that I give them *one more 
                         minute*--

                                     MCGANN
                              (quietly)
                         *You* tell Jim Taylor.

                                     HUBERT
                              (walking--fuming)
                         Washington! Always discussing the 
                         problems of Washington. Nobody ever 
                         thinks of the State--and my problems!
                              (With sudden 
                              determination)
                         I *will* tell Jim Taylor. It's high 
                         *time* I told him a thing or two!
                              (He pushes the door 
                              to a small ante room)

               In the ANTE-ROOM, Joe Paine and Jim Taylor are on their feet, 
               as Happy insert his head.

                                     HUBERT
                              (angrily)
                         Look here, Jim--if you and Joe are 
                         going to gab about this appointment 
                         *any* longer, I'm going ahead and 
                         see those committees!

                                     TAYLOR
                              (sharply)
                         You'll see those committees when 
                         we're finished!

                                     HUBERT
                              (meekly)
                         Yes, Jim.

               Hubert retires, closing the door. Jim Taylor turns back to 
               Paine.

                                     TAYLOR
                         That Happy Hopper is tougher to handle 
                         than a prima-donna.

                                     PAINE
                         --in other words, Jim--with this 
                         Willet Creek Dam on the fire--the 
                         man who goes to the Senate now in 
                         Sam Foley's place can't ask any 
                         questions or talk out of turn. We 
                         must be absolutely sure of him.

                                     TAYLOR
                         That's why I say Miller--Horace 
                         Miller. He jumped through hoops for 
                         the machine before we moved him up 
                         to the bench. He'll take orders.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim--suppose we didn't try to go 
                         through with this Willet Creek Dam--
                         suppose we postpone it until the 
                         next session of Congress--or drop it 
                         altogether--

                                     TAYLOR
                         That'd be a crime--after all this 
                         work--getting it buried in this 
                         Deficiency Bill as nice as you please--
                         approved--all ready to roll--

                                     PAINE
                         How much does the Willet Dam mean to 
                         you, Jim?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Joe--I've got a lot of people to 
                         take care of in this State.

                                     PAINE
                         I know, but is it worth the risk of 
                         a scandal now that a new man is going 
                         to the Senate?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Joe--what's the matter with you--
                         where you're concerned, I wouldn't 
                         take the slightest risk--'specially 
                         now after the great reputation you've 
                         made in the Senate. Why, look at 
                         this campaign I've started for you 
                         in all my papers. You're the logical 
                         man from the West on the National 
                         ticket--at the convention, anything 
                         can happen--

               There is a pause while Joe looks at a newspaper.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Joe, that's coming a long way in 
                         twenty years since I met you 
                         practising law down there in Main 
                         Street.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim--if what you say about the future 
                         is remotely possible--why not do as 
                         I say--drop things like this dam?

                                     TAYLOR
                         We can't drop it now, Joe. We bought 
                         the land around this Dam and we're 
                         holding it in dummy names. If we 
                         drop it or delay it--we are going to 
                         bring about investigations, and 
                         investigations will show that we own 
                         that land and are trying to sell it 
                         to the State under phoney names. No, 
                         Joe, in my judgment the only thing 
                         to do is push this Dam through--and 
                         get it over with.

                                     PAINE
                         Well, then appoint Miller--if you're 
                         sure he'll take orders.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Don't worry about Horace--he'll take 
                         orders. Come on--

               He goes to the door quickly, followed by Paine.

               In the GOVERNOR'S PRIVATE OFFICE, as Taylor and Paine barge 
               in, Happy Hubert throws his hands up.

                                     HUBERT
                         Well! Thank Heaven!

               The dictagraph buzzes.

                                     HUBERT
                              (shouting into it)
                         One minute! Just one minute!

                                     TAYLOR
                         Happy, we've got the man. Horace 
                         Miller!

                                     HUBERT
                         Horace Mill--!

                                     MCGANN
                              (leaping up)
                         Terrific! A born stooge! Horace'll 
                         perform like a trained seal.

                                     HUBERT
                         Jim--if I fling a party man like 
                         Horace in the face of those angry 
                         committees--

                                     TAYLOR
                         Happy, for reasons there isn't time 
                         to go into--it's got to be Miller! 
                         We've given you the man. Now write 
                         the ticket.
                              (Moving to the door)
                         Come on, Joe. Come on, Chick.

                                     HUBERT
                              (following them)
                         Now, wait fellows--great Heavens. 
                         I've got to see those angry committees 
                         first--feel them out a little--work 
                         for harmony--harmony.

                                     MCGANN
                         Harmony--and Horace Miller.

               The scene dissolves to the GOVERNOR'S OFFICE, full of 
               committee people, arranged in rows of chairs, closely packed 
               together. Hubert, at his desk, is addressing them.

                                     HUBERT
                              (spreading the old 
                              oil)
                         Gentlemen--in considering the 
                         candidates who might answer to the 
                         high qualifications of United States 
                         Senator--there was one name that 
                         shone out like a beacon--one I'm 
                         sure you will enthusiastically approve--
                         the Honorable *Horace Miller*.

               A minor bedlam breaks loose. Excited men rise and shout.

                                     VOICES
                         Miller! 
                         Not Horace Miller! 
                         A Taylor Man! 
                         The Veterans will have no part of 
                         him! 
                         A party man! One of Taylor's tools! 
                         Give us a clean man for a change! 
                         The New Citizen's Committee won't 
                         stand for Miller!

                                     HUBERT
                              (smiling sickly, 
                              wincing)
                         --please--

               The scene dissolves to the GOVERNOR'S LIBRARY in the HOPPER 
               HOME, at night. Hubert stands troubledly while Taylor, hat 
               in hand, is tearing into him and McGann just listens.

                                     TAYLOR
                         They put up *their* candidate? Who?

                                     HUBERT
                              (swallowing)
                         Henry Hill.

                                     TAYLOR
                         *Henry Hill?* That crackpot? That 
                         long-haired--! Why, you should have 
                         killed that so fast--!

                                     HUBERT
                         I--I couldn't, Jim. Those men were--

                                     TAYLOR
                         We can't help *what* they were! Forget 
                         'em!

                                     HUBERT
                         Jim, that bunch is out for blood. If 
                         I throw Horace in their teeth now--

                                     TAYLOR
                         I said forget 'em! Horace Miller 
                         goes to the Senate--and that settles 
                         it!

                                     HUBERT
                         I *won't* send Horace Miller!

                                     TAYLOR
                         *You won't?*

                                     HUBERT
                         I *won't* let you stand there 
                         callously and perhaps wreck my whole 
                         political future!

                                     TAYLOR
                         *Your* political future! I bought it 
                         for you and made you a present. And 
                         I can grab it back so fast it'll 
                         make your head spin. You got a nerve 
                         to stand there and worry about just 
                         *your future* when we're in this 
                         spot!
                              (Starting for the 
                              door)
                         The man is--*Miller*.

                                     MCGANN
                              (following Taylor; 
                              adds dryly)
                         M-i-double l-e-r.

               The two are gone, leaving Happy very unhappy. He stands for 
               a baleful instant. The butler appears.

                                     BUTLER
                         Mr. Edwards of the Citizen's Committee 
                         on the phone, sir.

                                     HUBERT
                              (groaning)
                         No! I'm out. I'm sick. I--I--
                              (Collapsing)
                         I'll talk.

               He picks up the phone.

                                     HUBERT
                              (brightening his manner)
                         *Good* evening, Mr. Edwards... Why, 
                         I have the matter under advisement 
                         this very moment. Now it isn't a 
                         question of my *objecting* to Henry 
                         Hill--

               BY A PHONE, Edwards is seen to be in considerable heat.

                                     EDWARDS
                              (into the phone)
                         Hill is the man every decent element 
                         wants--and *expects!* It's Henry 
                         Hill, Mr. Governor--or else!

               In the GOVERNOR'S LIBRARY, Hubert is seen wincing.

                                     HUBERT
                              (swallowing)
                         Yes, Mr. Edwards. Certainly. I shall 
                         bear that in mind. Good night.

               He hangs up, a picture of deepening misery, as Emma appears 
               at the door.

                                     EMMA
                         Dinner, Hubert.

                                     HUBERT
                              (absently)
                         I'll bear that in mind... What? Oh. 
                         Dinner. Pet--my stomach couldn't 
                         hold a bird seed.

                                     EMMA
                              (leaving)
                         We're waiting, Hubert.

               The scene dissolves to the DINING ROOM. The Hopper family is 
               seated at dinner. Six children are around the table--four 
               boys ranging from nine to sixteen, and a couple of in-between

                         Really, my dear--I don't feel like a 
                         thing.

                         What's the matter, Dad? Is it getting 
                         you down?

                                     HUBERT
                         Is *what* getting me down?

                              ("Number Three" son)
                         Looks like Henry Hill--huh, Pop?

                                     PETER
                         Naw--it's Horace Miller--or else!

               Hubert chokes on his soup.

                                     JIMMIE
                         Gee, I wouldn't appoint an old twerp 
                         like Horace Miller--Taylor or no 
                         Taylor!

                                     HUBERT
                         Taylor! May I ask what *Taylor* has 
                         to do with it?

                                     JIMMIE
                         Well, he's still running the show, 
                         ain't he, Dad?

                                     HUBERT
                         Emma! I will not have conversations 
                         of this sort carried on by the 
                         children at dinner!

                         Nonsense. Why don't you listen to 
                         your children for a change? You might 
                         actually learn something?

                                     HUBERT
                              (with sarcasm)
                         For instance, how to run the affairs 
                         of government? No doubt my children 
                         could make this appointment *for* me--
                         with the greatest ease!

                         Jeff Smith. He's the only Senator to 
                         have.

                                     OTIS
                         Sure. He ought to be President.

                         You, too! Fine. Fine. That's everybody 
                         heard from. Forgive my abysmal 
                         ignorance--but I don't know Jefferson

                         Yes, and right now he's the greatest 
                         hero we ever had. It's all over the 
                         headlines--

                         Sure. Didn't you see about the 
                         terrific forest fire all around 
                         Sweetwater?

                         I did. What about it?

                                     PETER
                         Well, Jeff put that out himself.

                         Himself!

                         Well--Jeff and the Rangers. He was 
                         out camping with 'em--and they saved 
                         hundreds of people and millions of 
                         dollars--

                         Now, if you really want a Senator--

                                     HUBERT
                         I do *not* want a Senator. And I do 
                         *not* want any more of this nonsense!

                         Why, I think it's very sweet of the

                         Washington said--by heart. An' "Boy 
                         Stuff's" got the swellest stuff in 
                         it.

                                     HUBERT
                         What stuff?

                                     PETER
                         "Boy Stuff." That's the name of Jeff's

                         If you want to do yourself some good

                         That settles it! I will not be 
                         attacked and belittled by my own 
                         children in my own home! My nerves 
                         are strained to the breaking point!

               He throws his serviette down and rushes from the dining-room.

                         Papa's mad, Mama.

               The scene dissolves to Hubert Hopper's STUDY, at night. Hubert 
               is pacing miserably as Emma enters, carrying his dinner on a 
               plate and setting it down on his desk.

                                     HUBERT
                              (in quiet, heart-
                              breaking appeal)
                         Emma! I'm a man at the end of his 
                         rope.

                                     EMMA
                         No wonder--without your dinner.

                                     HUBERT
                         Emma, which is it--Horace Miller or 
                         Henry Hill?

                                     EMMA
                              (starting out)
                         Well, your children are very bright--
                         and *they* say Jefferson Smith.

               And Emma, without pausing, passes on out. Hubert is beside 
               himself, and begins to pace again.

                                     HUBERT
                              (to himself, 
                              distractedly)
                         Henry Hill--Horace Miller--Henry 
                         Miller--Horace Hi--uh--Henry--

               Then on a desperate impulse, he takes a coin from his pocket 
               and gets ready to flip.

                                     HUBERT
                         Heads--Hill. Tails--Miller.

               He shuts his eyes and flips. The coin falls on the library 
               table. He rushes to it. His eyes pop.

               The COIN is seen standing on edge, leaned against a small 
               stack of magazines and papers.

               HUBERT is at his wit's end. Then his eyes travel over to the 
               paper on top of the pile. We see the NEWSPAPER HEADLINE:

                             GRATEFUL CITIZENS POUR GRATITUDE
                                    ON HERO JEFF SMITH

               Hubert stares at this headline, then suddenly, wildly, dashes 
               for the door.

               The scene dissolves to a STREET, at night: a row of simple, 
               white-frame houses with neatly kept front years and white 
               picket fences. Street lamps illumine the scene. A limousine 
               has come to a stop before one HOUSE, JEFFERSON SMITH'S, and 
               Governor Hubert Hopper is alighting. He pauses to look at 
               the house, is uncertain for an instant as to whether to go 
               in or not; then makes up his mind, pushes through the gate 
               and goes up the walk.

               At the DOOR, Hubert pauses again before knocking, but finally 
               does so. As his knuckles rap on the door, a terrific blast 
               of band music, blaring instruments badly played. lets go 
               from inside the house. Hubert, startled out of his wits, 
               turns to run for his life and makes two steps when the door 
               is opened; and there stands a smallish, somewhat gray, sweet-
               faced little lady (Jeff's Ma). The music goes on, so that 
               both have to raise their voices above it.

                                     MA
                         I *thought* I heard... Yes?

                                     HUBERT
                         Uh--Jefferson Smith's residence?

                                     MA
                         Yes. Come in.

                                     HUBERT
                         Is--uh--Jefferson Smith at home?

                                     MA
                         Certainly. Step right in.

               In the SITTING ROOM of the Smith Home, a neat, cozy room, 
               there are about twenty kids, ranging from nine to fifteen, 
               imitating a band. An older boy is leading them. They are of 
               all descriptions of dress; some in poor clothes--one with 
               his leg in a brace. Hubert edges into the room dumbfounded.

                                     MA
                              (loudly above the 
                              music)
                         I'll call Jeff. He's back in the 
                         shop--

               She starts across the room. Hubert remains, disconcerted by 
               the music. Suddenly, he looks off into the adjoining room 
               with curious interest--and also to escape the music, he moves 
               toward it.

               The adjoining room the Hubert enters is an OFFICE. It contains 
               everything from a roll-top desk crammed with mail, to a small 
               power printing press--to short-wave radio equipment. It is a 
               beehive of activity, with some eight or ten boys working 
               like the seven dwarfs--printing cards on the press--tying 
               copies of "Boy Stuff" into bundles--tinkering with the short-
               wave set. Hubert is set back on his heels by this unexpected 
               sight. He notes the little placards framed on the wall, 
               bearing the words of great men, and such admonitions as: 
               "When there's an edge--give it to the other fellow." "When a 
               man dies he clutches in his hands only that which he has 
               given away during his lifetime--" --Jean Jacques Rousseau. 
               "No man is good enough to govern another."--Abraham Lincoln. 
               "You've got to do your own growing, no matter how tall your 
               grandfather was." He notes the boys working at the radio--
               others working at the desk--while all the time, the little 
               power press goes on. Suddenly Ma returns, followed by 
               Jefferson Smith--fine looking, rangy, youthful--at the moment 
               wiping some white substance from his right hand.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Good evening, sir. I was just making 
                         some--
                              (Then, astoundedly)
                         Governor Hopper!

                                     MA
                         Well--I'll go to Halifax!

               Suddenly great excitement ensues.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Boys! Attention! Governor Hopper!

               The little fellows drop what they are doing and come to 
               attention while Jeff dives for a chair and whips it around.

                                     HUBERT
                         Now--now--please--that's quite all 
                         right. Relax, boys--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (at attention)
                         This--this is a great honor, sir. I--
                         I--

                                     HUBERT
                         Not at all. I've come to pay you a 
                         personal and official--and I might 
                         say--a *tardy* tribute, Mr. Smith, 
                         for your recent heroic conduct.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, now, I'm afraid that's been 
                         exaggerated some--

                                     HUBERT
                         No. No. A signal service to the State. 
                         Yes, indeed. And not only that but--
                         uh--I've heard of your excellent 
                         work in leading and guiding our youth--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--that's not work, sir--that's 
                         fun.

                                     HUBERT
                         No doubt. No doubt. And this fine 
                         little paper--"Boy Stuff"--with, I 
                         dare say, an *enormous* circulation 
                         in the State.

                                     MA
                         Well--it started with a little 
                         mimeograph sheet--and it's just grown 
                         out of all sense and reason--

                                     HUBERT
                         Excellent! Excellent! My boy, I'm 
                         convinced our State has a great debt 
                         of gratitude to you--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, now--

                                     MA
                         Jefferson--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, Ma?

                                     MA
                         Excuse me for interrupting, Governor, 
                         but--
                              (To Jeff)
                         --that plaster's gonna harden any 
                         second, son.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (on edge)
                         Gosh! You see sir--I was fixing some 
                         plaster for a cast on Amos' leg--
                         he's always chewing 'em off. I'll 
                         only be a minute--if you'll excuse 
                         me, sir--

                                     HUBERT
                         By all means--by all means.

               Jeff exits hurriedly.

                                     MA
                         Maybe you'd like to come along and 
                         watch, Governor? Jefferson's done a 
                         wonderful job with that leg.

                                     HUBERT
                         Why, of course.

               Ma starts out after Jeff--Hubert follows. He descends the 
               few steps after her.

               The PET SHOP, which Ma and Hubert enter, is a crudely built 
               room, another addition to the house proper. The instant they 
               set foot inside, the damnedest furore breaks loose--dogs 
               bark--parrots scream, until Hubert is about to lose his mind. 
               Jeff is placing his plaster on the center table and is 
               stepping to one of the cages.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (calling)
                         Jerry! Blackie! Queenie! Let's have 
                         it quiet, fellows!

                                     MA
                              (calling)
                         Now, now, now!
                              (To Hubert)
                         It's all right, Governor.

               She moves toward the table--Hubert following.

                                     HUBERT
                         A pet shop?

                                     MA
                         Well, it sort of got to be--from 
                         Jeff just pullin' splinters and things--

               Jeff pulls down from a cage Amos, a Siamese monkey, and sets 
               him on the TABLE. Amos is fighting fiercely. The cast on his 
               leg hangs down in shreds. Hubert, approaching, is amazed and 
               startled. Jefferson starts to pull the old cast from Amos' 
               leg.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (to Ma)
                         Here, Skinny, give me a hand. Hold 
                         Amos' tail down so he can't get it 
                         around my waist.

               Ma holds the monkey's tail as directed--or tries to.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (to Amos)
                         Now, now, now--that isn't going to 
                         get you any place. Get a firm grip, 
                         Ma!

                                     MA
                         Satan's in this little fella tonight!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (at work)
                         Sorry about this, Governor. But it 
                         won't take a minute. You were saying 
                         something in the other room, sir--

                                     HUBERT
                         Well--yes--I was saying--the State 
                         should reward you--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Aw--

                                     HUBERT
                         --And it is in my power to confer a 
                         very signal honor upon you. In my 
                         official capacity, therefore, I--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Ma! Hold him!

                                     MA
                         I just can't, son--not the head and 
                         tail both!

                                     HUBERT
                         Uh--could--could I help--?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Thanks, Governor--*yes*! Do you mind? 
                         His head--Ma'll take the tail.

                                     HUBERT
                         The--head?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Just get one hand against each ear 
                         there--keep his face straight up.

               Hubert timidly does as directed. Amos yells--Hubert almost 
               lets go.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Amos!
                              (To Governor)
                         Hold 'im, Governor. That's right. 
                         Cinch him down. Fine--fine--

               Jeff starts to put the plaster on.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         What were you saying, Governor? Sorry.

                                     HUBERT
                              (determinedly--once 
                              and for all)
                         I said, sir--in my official capacity--
                         as an honorary gesture--I appoint 
                         you to the United States Senate!

               It does not penetrate to Jeff that instant.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Now, Amos, now--
                              (Then, as Hubert's 
                              words hit)
                         What?

                                     MA
                         What?

               At this instant, Amos wriggles his head and sinks his teeth 
               into the soft, white thumb of Governor Hopper.

                                     HUBERT
                              (yelling)
                         Ow! He bit me!

               He lets go of Amos, who wriggles and is nearly off the table. 
               Jeff and Ma make a dive for him.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (yelling)
                         Amos! Amos!

               And, added to everything else, the pet shop goes up in a 
               roar.

               The scene dissolves to NEWSPAPER HEADLINES, a flaring, eight-
               column head reads:

                         GOVERNOR HOPPER IN SURPRISE APPOINTMENT

               And another headline (with picture of Jefferson Smith):

                                   HERO JEFFERSON SMITH
                               IS GOVERNOR'S SENATE CHOICE

               The scene dissolves to the GOVERNOR'S LIBRARY, in the morning. 
               Taylor, McGann, Hubert and Paine are present.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (pounding a newspaper 
                              in his hand, yelling 
                              at Happy)
                         --a *boy ranger* a squirrel chaser--
                         to the United States Senate!

                                     HUBERT
                         Jim--the answer to a prayer--manna 
                         from heaven--the man *we want*--and 
                         the votes *we need*--

                                     MCGANN
                         He's batty!

                                     HUBERT
                         Listen--the simpleton of all time--a 
                         big-eyed patriot--knows Washington 
                         and Lincoln by heart--stood at 
                         attention in the Governor's presence--
                         collects stray boys and cats--

                                     TAYLOR
                         What!

                                     HUBERT
                         Joe--*you* know what I'm talking 
                         about. The perfect man. Never in 
                         politics in his life. Wouldn't find 
                         out what it's all about in two 
                         *years*, lets alone two months. But 
                         the important thing--and this was 
                         the genius of the stroke--*it means 
                         votes*!

                                     MCGANN
                         Oh--oh.

                                     HUBERT
                         He's the hero of fifty thousand boys 
                         and a hundred thousand parents. Look 
                         at these congratulations pouring in! 
                         I tell you, gentlemen, by this one 
                         statesman-like act, I have--

                                     TAYLOR
                              (deadly)
                         But you went ahead and made this 
                         appointment without asking me--

                                     HUBERT
                         Jim--when the lightning hit, I--I 
                         just--

                                     TAYLOR
                         *But you never asked me*!

                                     HUBERT
                              (petulantly)
                         Oh--Jim!

                                     PAINE
                         Wait a minute, boys. Happy may have 
                         hit on something tremendous here. 
                         Rather than let Miller or anyone 
                         else in at this stage, we simply put 
                         blinders on this simple son of nature--
                         and turn him loose on monuments. 
                         He's completely out of the way in 
                         Washington, and as Happy says, you 
                         make political capital out of it at 
                         home.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Joe--do you mean to say--do you think 
                         you can actually *handle* this--this 
                         whatever-you-call-it in Washington?

                                     PAINE
                              (quietly)
                         A young patriot?--Who recites 
                         Jefferson and Lincoln?--turned loose 
                         in our nation's capital? I think I 
                         can.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (after a pause)
                         Chick--turn the ballyhoo boys loose 
                         on this right away. Greatest 
                         appointment ever made. A banquet--
                         declare a holiday.

                                     MCGANN
                         Wow! A star-spangled banquet--and 
                         one of Happy's windy spiels--music--
                         little kids--the flag--a tear-jerker 
                         from way back--!

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE, a series of headlines 
               screaming approval of Happy's choice--pictures of Happy with 
               Smith--of Happy shaking hands with person after person in 
               his office--of Jeff Smith surrounded by boys in his home, 
               cheering him, clustered around--and adults shaking his hand--
               of telegrams coming to him in stacks--of, finally at night, 
               the Boy's Club band in the street, marching to a martial 
               air, banners at their head reading: "OUR OWN SENATOR JEFFERSON 
               SMITH."

               This dissolves to a BANQUET HALL, in which HOPPER, seen at 
               close range, in white tie--beaming--on his feet at the banquet 
               table--is addressing an assemblage.

                                     HUBERT
                         --in the hands of your Governor lay 
                         the power to confer a great honor--
                         to raise a man to the high office of 
                         United States Senator. And how did 
                         your Governor confer that honor?

               The scene then reveals a great, horseshoe banquet table, 
               crowded with leading citizens. At Hubert's left and right 
               sit Jefferson and Ma, Mrs. Hopper and Paine. MA is seen 
               beaming, while JEFFERSON looks dazed and nervous.

                                     HUBERT'S VOICE
                         Did he give it to some wealthy or 
                         influential citizen merely to curry 
                         favor? No!
                              (As Paine is seen 
                              looking down at Jeff)
                         Did he give it to some unworthy 
                         political hireling? No!

               TAYLOR AND MCGANN are seen seated at one of the wing tables--
               to be out of sight. McGann raised his eyes to heaven for 
               relief.

                                     HUBERT'S VOICE
                         What *did* he do? True to our party's 
                         tradition--

               EDWARDS is seen listening skeptically.

                                     HUBERT'S VOICE
                         --he went down among the people--
                              (warming to a climax, 
                              the banquet now in 
                              full view)
                         --and there found--a nugget! A hero!! 
                         That was the spirit your Governor 
                         acted in. And in that spirit we have 
                         come together tonight to acclaim and 
                         bid Godspeed to--Senator Jefferson 
                         Smith.

               Strong applause--people get to their feet--a band blares a 
               salute. Hubert motions Jeff to get to his feet. Dry-mouthed, 
               Jeff rises. The noise dies out. They wait.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (simply--slowly)
                         Well--uh--thank you. I--I sort of 
                         have a feeling there's been a big 
                         mistake--I mean--
                              (as gentle laughter 
                              greets him)
                         --I--I can't think of a greater honor. 
                         It isn't just mine. It belongs to 
                         all my boys.
                              (Turning to Paine)
                         Sitting with a man like Senator Paine--
                         I can't tell you how much greater 
                         that makes the honor. He and my father 
                         were very dear friends.

               PAINE, startled, is seen looking up at Jeff.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         My father used to tell me that Joseph 
                         Paine was the finest man he ever 
                         knew.

               The applause startles Paine. He looks down, two places 
               removed, to MA, who is leaning over, smiling at him. Her 
               mouth forms the words: "Hello, Joseph."

               We again see the banquet hall in full view, as the applause 
               stops.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I don't think I'll be much help to 
                         you, Senator Paine.
                              (Laughter from the 
                              audience)
                         But I *can* promise you this--I'll 
                         uphold the honor with all my might--
                         I'll do nothing to disgrace the name 
                         of--Senator of the United States.
                              (He sits down amid a 
                              storm of applause)

               TAYLOR AND MCGANN are seen applauding mechanically.

                                     MCGANN
                         Who'd ever think I'd be back in Sunday 
                         School?

               The applause continues in the banquet hall. Then, suddenly, 
               a band starts to play off scene. All heads turn to the rear 
               of the hall. The BIG DOORS are pushed open and the Boy's 
               Club Band--followed by more of Jeff's boys--comes marching 
               in. The boys range in size from tiny fellows in front--
               building back up, row by row, to the larger fellows in rear. 
               They march into the middle of the table formation. The band 
               plays a march. The banqueters cheer. JEFFERSON'S eyes are 
               alight. The boys come to a stop, marking time, until the 
               band stops. A little fellow--Jackie Hopper--steps to the 
               front. He is carrying something wrapped up. HUBERT AND EMMA 
               are seen watching this.

                                     EMMA
                              (proudly)
                         Jackie!

               TAYLOR AND MCGANN are also watching.

                                     MCGANN
                         So help me--it's Snow White and a 
                         thousand dwarfs!

               There is a silence in the hall as Jackie wets his lips and 
               addresses Jeff.

                                     JACKIE
                              (stumbling and nervous 
                              with a memorized 
                              speech)
                         Senator Jefferson Smith--we are very 
                         proud on this great occas--the Boy 
                         Rangers take this oppor--uh--
                              (lifts the package)
                         --in token of their--uh--in token of 
                         this--
                              (breaking off, ad 
                              libbing)
                         --It's a briefcase, Jeff! All the 
                         kids pitched in! It's for to carry 
                         your laws when you get there!

               He rushes forward and pushes the gift into Jeff's hands. The 
               banqueters then applaud vigorously. Jeff, speechless and 
               touched, stands holding the briefcase. The band strikes up 
               "Auld Lang Syne." Everyone stands up, and joins the song. 
               Paine moves from his place over to Ma.

               Ma is seen singing--as Paine comes to her side. She stops 
               singing. They shake hands warmly. Then Paine, looking at 
               Jeff, pantomimes: "Is that the little shaver I knew when he 
               was this high?" Ma nods. She starts to sign again, and we 
               get another full view of the hall. The song is sung earnestly 
               by the boys, the banqueters joining it.

               JEFFERSON has opened the BRIEFCASE and is staring at it. It 
               is seen to be inscribed:

                                 SENATOR JEFFERSON SMITH
                              OUR BEST RANGER--OUR BEST PAL

               JEFF is looking off at the boys--his eyes a little dim; this 
               is the most wonderful moment of his life.

               This dissolves to a Washington-bound TRAIN, on which we see 
               Jefferson and Senator Paine. Jefferson is fishing out of his 
               briefcase a copy of "Boy Stuff."

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well, it isn't much, but if you 
                         insist, here's this week's.
                              (He hands it over)

                                     PAINE
                              (examining it)
                         "Boy Stuff." Why, printer's ink runs 
                         in your veins, Jeff. You're just 
                         like your father.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Thank you, sir.

                                     PAINE
                         Even to the hat. Same old dreamer, 
                         too. One look at you and I can see 
                         him, back of his old roll top desk, 
                         hat and all, getting out his paper. 
                         Always kept his hat on his head so 
                         as to be ready to do battle. Clayton 
                         Smith, editor and publisher, and 
                         champion of lost causes.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yeah, Dad always used to say the 
                         only causes worth fighting for were 
                         lost causes.

                                     PAINE
                         You don't have to tell me Jeff. We 
                         were a team, the two of us, a 
                         struggling editor and a struggling 
                         lawyer. The twin champions of lost 
                         causes, they used to call us.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Ma's told me about it a thousand 
                         times.

                                     PAINE
                         His last fight was his best, Jeff. 
                         He and his little four-page paper 
                         against that mining syndicate and 
                         all to defend the right of one small 
                         miner who stuck to his claim. You 
                         know, they tried everything, bribery, 
                         intimidation, then--well--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, Ma found him slumped over his 
                         desk that morning...

                                     PAINE
                         Shot in the back. I was there. I can 
                         see him at that old roll top desk, 
                         still with his hat on... still with 
                         his hat on...

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I know. I suppose, Mr. Paine, when a 
                         fellow bucks up against a big 
                         organization like that, one man by 
                         himself can't get very far, can he?

                                     PAINE
                         No.

               The scene fades out.

               In the TRAIN SHED (Washington D.C.), we see McGann, Paine, 
               Jefferson, Porters and bags.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Washington!

                                     MCGANN
                         Yeah, for the fifth time, Senator--
                         Washington.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         My pigeons--I better see about my 
                         pigeons.

                                     MCGANN
                         The porter's got them. They're coming.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (running out)
                         Just a minute, I better make sure.

                                     MCGANN
                              (to Paine)
                         Boy! My head's like a balloon--for 
                         two whole days. I never knew there 
                         was so much American history.

                                     PAINE
                              (kidding)
                         You can't find it in racing forms, 
                         Chick.

                                     MCGANN
                         Fine thing Jim Taylor wished on me--
                         show him the monuments--I need this 
                         job like I need ten pounds.

               Jeff comes back carrying the pigeons.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Here they are--I got them. They are 
                         all right.

                                     MCGANN
                         Well, that ends that crisis. This 
                         way, Senator.

               They exit.

               At the STATION: Jeff, McGann, Paine and Porters walk in. 
               Susan Paine and three other girls rush in and kiss Paine and 
               Jeff. The girls carry little cans or boxes with milk fund 
               ribbons on them--in which they collect money.

                                     GIRLS
                         Hello, Father. 
                         I saw him first. 
                         He's mine---

               Jeff is utterly confused by the four girls trying to kiss 
               him.

                                     PAINE
                         Here, here, Susan--this is Jeff Smith--
                         our new Senator.

                                     SUSAN
                         I don't care to meet anybody until I 
                         get paid--come on--come on. One dollar 
                         each, please, for the Milk Fund.

                                     ANOTHER GIRL
                         If you don't pay quickly you'll get 
                         kissed again.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (confused and searching 
                              in his pockets)
                         A dollar--four dollars. Gosh! You 
                         wouldn't settle for some keys, would 
                         you?

                                     PAINE
                         Here, Jeff, I'll advance it for you.--
                         Fine introduction to the nation's 
                         capital!

                                     MCGANN
                              (pulling out a roll)
                         Here, I'll take a dozen of those 
                         things. Miss Paine.

                                     SUSAN
                              (taking money)
                         Thank you, Mister McGann, you have a 
                         very kind heart.

               McGann "burns" at not being kissed.

                                     PAINE
                         This is my daughter, Susan, and her 
                         friends--Senator Jefferson Smith.

                                     GIRLS
                         How do you do? 
                         Meet the new Senator. 
                         I thought he'd be a Ranger with a 
                         big hat.

                                     SUSAN
                              (pointing at the 
                              pigeons)
                         What have you got there, Senator?

                                     MCGANN
                         Pigeons--to carry messages back to 
                         Ma.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Just for the fun of it.--You see the 
                         one that makes it back home in the 
                         fastest time, I am going to enter in 
                         the nationals.

                                     SUSAN
                         Wonderful!

                                     ANOTHER GIRL
                         There's romance in him.

                                     SUSAN
                         Imagine having love notes delivered 
                         to you by a pigeon.

               At this instant two middle-aged men, slightly hard-faced, 
               named Cook and Griffith, descend on the party.

                                     COOK
                         Joe!

                                     GRIFFITH
                         Hello, Chick.

                                     MCGANN
                         H'ya, Carl--h'ya, Bill!

                                     PAINE
                         Jeff--meet Mr. Cook and Mr. Griffith--
                         members of our State headquarters 
                         here.

               Cook and Griffiths fall on Jeff, wringing his hand and again 
               Jeff can't get a word in. He has put his pigeons down.

                                     COOK
                         Great pleasure, Senator! Yes *sir*. 
                         Great appointment! You'll do the old 
                         State proud!

                                     GRIFFITH
                         Welcome, Senator. This wild life 
                         around here is a little different 
                         from what you're used to. They wear 
                         high heels! Hah! Hah!

                                     PAINE
                         Well, let's get started. Bill--you've 
                         made reservations at the hotel for 
                         the Senator and Chick--

                                     COOK
                         All fixed. Same floor with you, Joe.

                                     SUSAN
                              (with lifted eyebrows)
                         How nice.

                                     PAINE
                         All right, we'll take Jeff with us--

                                     SUSAN
                         I'm afraid we won't have room in the 
                         car, Father. Senator Smith can follow 
                         with Mr. McGann and the pigeons.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Sure.

                                     SUSAN
                         Well, we *must* see a lot of you, 
                         Senator. Come, Father.

               Paine is being pulled away by Susan. The girls, waving good-
               bye to Jeff, follow. Griffith walks along a bit with Paine.

                                     PAINE
                              (calling back--
                              cautioning)
                         Chick--

                                     MCGANN
                         I've got 'im, Joe. Be right along.

               PAINE AND GRIFFITH are now seen together.

                                     PAINE
                         Are you ready for him, Bill?

                                     GRIFFITH
                         All set. Foley's rooms in the Senate 
                         office building--nice, big clean 
                         desk--lot of Senator stationery to 
                         write his little boys on--and Foley's 
                         secretary, Saunders, to make it look 
                         like the real thing--

                                     PAINE
                         Good. Are the newspaper men at the 
                         hotel?

                                     GRIFFITH
                         Yup--Sweeney, Flood, Farrell--waiting 
                         for you--

                                     PAINE
                         Fine. The first thing to do is--
                         present Mr. Smith to the press--in 
                         the *right* way. Hurry him along, 
                         Bill.

                                     GRIFFITH
                         How do you feel, champ?

                                     PAINE
                         All right, why?

                                     GRIFFITH
                         Your name's spreading like wild-fire 
                         out here--you are the winterbook 
                         favorite to get on the National 
                         ticket.

                                     PAINE
                         Oh! Go away.

               Newsmen come up with cameras to photograph Paine.

               JEFFERSON, MCGANN AND COOK are seen together.

                                     MCGANN
                         All right, Senator--let's get these 
                         bags and the livestock together--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (suddenly pointing)
                         Look! There it is!

                                     MCGANN
                         What? Who?

               We see what Jeff is pointing at--the CAPITOL DOME, up on 
               "The Hill"--framed in one of the station portals.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         The Capitol Dome!

               The GROUP looks at Jeff dryly.

                                     COOK
                         Yes, sir--big as life. Been there 
                         some time now.

                                     MCGANN
                         Yes, sir.
                              (Busily, to porters)
                         All right, boys--let's go.

               Jeff has taken a few steps in the direction of the Dome. 
               Griffith joins them, and McGann, Cook and Griffith start off 
               with porters.

                                     MCGANN
                         This way, Senator.

               McGann, Cook and Griffith are seen moving on, not conscious 
               that Jeff isn't following.

                                     GRIFFITH
                         Say, we thought--maybe we ought to 
                         meet him in short pants--you know--
                         with hatchets.

               Cook points to the pigeons a porter carriers.

                                     COOK
                         What's he bringing pigeons for?

                                     MCGANN
                              (sour and sore)
                         What for? Why, suppose there's a 
                         storm--all lines are down--how you 
                         gonna get a message to Ma?

               Cook and Griffith give McGann alarmed looks.

               JEFF is seen, with his eyes fixed ahead, through the portals, 
               on the Dome; he is drawn unconsciously in that directions.

               MCGANN, COOK AND GRIFFITH are approaching the door to the 
               outside.

                                     MCGANN
                              (looks back)
                         Okay, Senator--right through here--

               They all stop dead.

                                     MCGANN
                         Where is he? Hey, Senator! What's 
                         the matter with that cookie? I *told* 
                         him to--. Come on, let's find him. 
                         Hey, Smith!

               The three start back into the station.

               The scene dissolves to the STATION, where McGann, Cook and 
               Griffith are coming together.

                                     COOK
                         Positively not in the station! Gone!

                                     MCGANN
                         I'll brain that guy! Well--call Paine--
                         call Saunders--

               Carl rushes off.

                                     MCGANN
                              (yelling through cupped 
                              hands)
                         Hey--*ranger*!

               The scene dissolves to a PHONE BOOTH, in which Carl Cook is 
               telephoning.

                                     COOK
                         --Saunders! Smith hasn't showed up 
                         at his office there, has he?... No?... 
                         What do you mean 'the slip'?... What's 
                         so funny?

               In JEFF SMITH'S OUTER OFFICE (SENATE OFFICE BUILDING) SAUNDERS 
               is on the phone. She is a girl in her late twenties--pretty--
               and a shrewd, keen, abrupt creature--who, at the moment laughs 
               mirthlessly.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Nothing. Have you tried a butterfly 
                         net?

               In the PHONE BOOTH:

                                     CARL
                         Lay off, Saunders. If your feet felt 
                         like mine... Listen--if he shows up 
                         there--Paine's waiting at the hotel 
                         with newspaper men--let him know 
                         right away--understand?

               In JEFF'S OUTER OFFICE, Saunders, on the phone, is regarding 
               Diz Moore--a fairly young, disheveled, freckle-faced Irishman, 
               at the moment stretched out on the sofa.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Sure. Sure. I'll hang a light in the 
                         steeple. One if by land--two if by 
                         sea!... Okay!
                              (Hanging up)
                         Diz--you won't believe it. Daniel 
                         Boone's *lost*!

                                     DIZ
                         No!

               The door bursts open and a reporter called Nosey sticks his 
               head in.

                                     NOSEY
                              (a fast talker)
                         Is this new guy Smith here yet? I 
                         want a little interview. How about 
                         it? Arrived yet--?

                                     SAUNDERS AND DIZ
                              (together)
                         No! Scram! Blow!

               Nosey slams out.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         How do you *like* this! You don't 
                         suppose that ranger met up with some 
                         kids--and took 'em for a hike!

                                     DIZ
                         That--or he's out blazing trails. 
                         He'll show up.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Sure--sure. He must have a compass 
                         with him.

               The scene dissolves to the STATION, where McGann, Cook and 
               Griffith are very tired men.

                                     MCGANN
                              (mopping his brow)
                         --that dummy wandered off and got 
                         hit by a taxi! Bill--call the 
                         hospitals--hurry up--!

               Bill runs off, McGann yelling after him.

                                     MCGANN
                         And while you're at it, get me a 
                         bed!

                                     COOK
                         Let's send out a pigeon!

                                     MCGANN
                         Blow a bugle!

               The exterior of the CAPITOL BUILDING is seen, in the view 
               from the Library of Congress side, showing both wings of 
               House and Senate with the steps leading up to the massive 
               columns.

                                     SPIELER'S VOICE
                         --and there you have it, folks--the 
                         Capitol of the United States--the 
                         home of Congress--

               IN FRONT OF THE CAPITOL, people in a bus are craning their 
               necks out--*and we find Jeff among them*! A spieler is 
               standing in front near the driver, speaking through a small 
               megaphone.

                                     SPIELER
                         Yes, *sir*! You are looking at the 
                         building where your law-makers have 
                         sat since the time of Washington--

               In the BUS, Jeff looks at the Spieler suddenly.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Since the time of Adams--not 
                         Washington.

                                     SPIELER
                         How's that, buddy?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I said--I mean--Washington didn't 
                         live to see it finished. Congress 
                         didn't move here from Philadelphia 
                         till eighteen hundred.

                                     SPIELER
                              (trying to scare him 
                              out of his facts)
                         Oh--you're *sure* of that now?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes. Washington laid the cornerstone 
                         though--wearing an apron for the 
                         ceremony that was embroidered by 
                         Madame Lafayette--

                                     SPIELER
                              (interrupting)
                         Yes, *sir*.
                              (Quickly to driver)
                         Let's *go* Henry.

               The driver throws the bus into gear as the spieler gives 
               Jefferson a dirty look.

                                     SPIELER
                         Now, on your right, folks--you see 
                         the Library of Congress--

               All heads turn to look out of the right side of the bus, and 
               the exterior of the CONGRESSIONAL LIBRARY is seen as the bus 
               moves along.

                                     SPIELER'S VOICE
                         --greatest library in the world. 
                         Five million books and two and a 
                         half-million maps, charts, and musical 
                         compositions--

               In the BUS, JEFFERSON, seen closely, is looking at the 
               building in an awed manner.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You left out the most important thing! 
                         That's where you see the Constitution 
                         and the Declaration of Independence!

               The SPIELER is seen getting pretty sore at this kind of thing.

                                     SPIELER
                         As the gentleman says--without anybody 
                         asking him--that's where you see 
                         those original, priceless documents--
                         the Constitution and Declaration of 
                         Independence.
                              (To Jeff, sarcastically)
                         Much obliged, my friend. You're a 
                         great help to me. Let's *go*, Henry!

               The scene dissolves to a series of views (a TRAVEL MONTAGE) 
               of the Washington monuments as Jeff sees them--his amazement 
               and reverence on seeing the Supreme Court Building, the White 
               House, the Washington Monuments, Constitution Avenue, and so 
               on.

               Then the LINCOLN MEMORIAL comes to view and JEFF is seen 
               walking up the steps--eyes fixed ahead wonderingly. Soon he 
               approaches the top steps and now his is on the floor of the 
               shrine. Suddenly he stops dead, and the full figure of LINCOLN 
               comes to view--the huge, overpowering figure, seated in that 
               great armchair. It is an almost breathing sculpture of the 
               great, humane man, looking out.

               JEFFERSON, seen closely, is over-awed and reverent, looking 
               up at the face. With mechanical steps he comes forward, 
               against a background of enormous columns which shed a powerful 
               solemnity upon the scene. He comes forward slowly and stops, 
               and the words on the statue appear:

                                      IN THIS TEMPLE
                              AS IN THE HEARTS OF THE PEOPLE
                               FOR WHOM HE SAVED THE UNION
                                  THE MEMORY OF ABRAHAM
                                         LINCOLN
                                   IS ENSHRINED FOREVER

               JEFFERSON has his heart in his mouth. His head turns slowly 
               to the left.

               On the LEFT WALL, the Second Inaugural Address of Lincoln, 
               carved in the stone, appears, and JEFFERSON'S head turns 
               back to Lincoln. He quotes in a half-voice--looking up as 
               though he heard Lincoln say it:

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (softly)
                         '--with malice toward none, with 
                         charity for all--with firmness in 
                         the right as God gives us to see the 
                         right...'

               He breaks off and turns his head to the right.

               Then at the RIGHT WALL, the Gettysburg Address, carved in 
               stone, appears, and JEFFERSON, turning back to the figure of 
               Lincoln, again recites:

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (softly)
                         '--that these dead shall not have 
                         died in vain--that this nation, under 
                         God, shall--'

               LINCOLN'S FIGURE is seen at close range as Jefferson's voice 
               comes over.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         '--have a new birth of freedom--and 
                         that Government of the people, by 
                         the people, for the people--shall 
                         not perish from the earth...'

               While Jefferson says these words and while we hold on the 
               face of the man who uttered them the scene dissolves slowly.

               JEFF'S SENATE OUTER OFFICE is seen at dusk; the light is 
               murky. Saunders is pacing a groove in the carpet; Diz Moore 
               is still reclining on the sofa.

                                     DIZ
                         Getting on to dinner, isn't it, pal?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (grimly)
                         I give that Trail Blazer five more 
                         minutes to show up--
                              (turning on the desk 
                              lamp viciously)
                         --*five more minutes*!

               The phone rings.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (indicating the ringing 
                              phone)
                         Well--who d'you take this time--Paine, 
                         Bill, Carl--or McGann?

                                     DIZ
                         Hey--you're into me for a buck 
                         already. I say--McGann. Shoot the 
                         whole dollar.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Okay. For the dollar, I give you 
                         McGann *and* Bill and Carl. I got 
                         Paine.
                              (Picking up the phone)
                         Hello... Oh, yes.

               Saunders does a 'gimme' gesture at Diz.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No, not yet, Senator Paine--not hide 
                         nor hair of the man. You mean to say 
                         the boys haven't--?

                                     DIZ
                         Eight to five Little Boy Blue is 
                         plastered.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (into the phone)
                         Well, why don't they try the police--
                         get some blood hounds--or Indian 
                         guides--

               In a CORNER OF THE PAINE HOTEL APARTMENT, Paine is on the 
               telephone, and is smiling.

                                     PAINE
                         As a last resort, maybe... Now wait, 
                         Saunders--you *can't* leave there! 
                         The one place he knows in this city--
                         is the Senate office--and you stay 
                         there and wait... it isn't *that* 
                         late--

               In JEFF'S OUTER OFFICE:

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (into the phone)
                         All right--then another half hour. 
                         Just *one* half hour, Senator. 
                         Goodbye.

               She hangs up angrily and storms away.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Why don't I quit? Why don't I pick 
                         up and walk out of here?

               She passes Diz, grabbing the dollar bill which he holds up 
               like a torch--and goes right on talking.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Tell me why!

                                     DIZ
                              (looking at his empty 
                              hand)
                         Well, because you're doing all right 
                         at the minute.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         When Foley died, why didn't I clear 
                         out? How many times, did you hear me 
                         say I was fed up on politics and--? 
                         But *no*--I let 'em talk me into 
                         staying. Secretary to a leader of 
                         little squirts. Why? Because I need 
                         the job and a new suit of clothes.

                                     DIZ
                         Would you settle for a husband?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (absently--walking)
                         What's this, Diz?

                                     DIZ
                         That old standing offer from Diz 
                         Moore--Poet of Washington 
                         Correspondents.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (absently)
                         Huh?

                                     DIZ
                         You know--Mrs. Diz Moore.

               She is walking furiously, her mind only half on what Diz is 
               saying.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh--that again. Yeah.

                                     DIZ
                              (flatly)
                         I would cherish you--and stay sober.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Diz, you're a swell playmate--but--. 
                         Maybe if I saw you once with your 
                         hair combed, or something--or--no, 
                         no--I don't think even that would do 
                         it--

                                     DIZ
                              (resigned)
                         Well, if you're sure it wouldn't--no 
                         use combing my hair for nothing.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No--don't do it. I'm sure. The truth 
                         is, Diz--there's no man I've seen 
                         yet or--must be something wrong with 
                         me. I've been feeling low for weeks.

                                     DIZ
                         You got worms.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What! Who?

                                     DIZ
                         You know--little worms--ambition.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yeah. Should have seen me seven years 
                         ago--when I came to this town. *Now* 
                         what am I?--chambermaid to the Pied 
                         Piper of Jackson City; *Honorary* 
                         appointment! Scratch this thing an 
                         you'll find they wanted a dope here 
                         for two months.

               There is a knock on the door.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (yelling angrily)
                         Yes!

               The door doesn't open at once.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes!

               The door opens slowly and Jefferson's head pokes in.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What is it?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Office of--Senator Smith?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         *No*!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (looks at number on 
                              door)
                         The man downstairs said number--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No!

               Startled and scared, Jeff backs out, closing the door.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (to Diz, picking up 
                              where she left off)
                         Yup--they must have picked the prize 
                         dummy--
                              (Then, struck by 
                              lightning--pointing 
                              at the door)
                         *Wait* a minute! That wouldn't be--
                         *Daniel Boone*!

               She makes a beeline for the door, yanking it open.

               In the CORRIDOR, Jeff is gazing around at the door numbers 
               bewilderedly--when Saunders appears.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (excitedly)
                         What's your name?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         J-Jefferson Smith.

               She makes a run and a grab for him.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh--oh! Come right in! Yes, indeed. 
                         Right this way--

               She pulls him into the office, Jeff alarmed and speechless.

               In the OFFICE, Saunders is seen dragging him in, her movements 
               very excited.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Now, hold it, Senator. Stay right 
                         where you are. Don't go 'way--

               And she rushes for the phone. Diz' feet come off the sofa 
               with a thud.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (into the phone, 
                              excitedly)
                         Hello--hello. Helen! Get the Shoreham--
                         Paine's apartment. Hurry, will you!

               She holds the phone.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Is--is something the matter?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh, no--no!
                              (Then with heavy 
                              sarcasm)
                         My dear *Senator*--it may be customary 
                         out on the prairie to take French 
                         leave of people and not be heard of 
                         again for five hours--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Gee--I'm sorry about that, Miss--you 
                         *are* Miss Saunders, aren't you?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes, I'm Saunders--and this is Mr. 
                         Moore--a member of the press. Meet 
                         the *Senator*, Mr. Moore.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (seizing Diz' hand)
                         Pleased to meet you, sir.

                                     DIZ
                              (wincing under the 
                              handshake)
                         How do you do, Senator? I see you 
                         made it.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Made it? Oh! Yes. Silly of me--you 
                         see, what happened was--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (suddenly into the 
                              phone, with heavy 
                              sarcasm)
                         Hello... Yes, Senator Paine. Yes. 
                         Right here. Just came in--under his 
                         own power... Yes--he's sober--that's 
                         the very next thing on the schedule... 
                         Yes, sir, I'll have him right over.

               She hangs up, and comes forward to Jefferson.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Gee, I'm sorry. You see, it wasn't 
                         until I was fairly well along in the 
                         bus that I realized--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Did you say--bus?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         One of those sightseers--you know. 
                         You see, I--gosh, I've never been 
                         called absent-minded or... but there 
                         it was all of a sudden--looking right 
                         at me through one of the station 
                         doors--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         There *what* was?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The Dome--the Capitol Dome--

               Saunders just looks at Diz with wide eyes.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         --big as life--sparkling away there 
                         under the sun. I--I started walking 
                         toward it--and there was a bus outside--
                         and--well--I--I just naturally got 
                         aboard--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Most natural thing in the world!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I don't believe I've been so thrilled 
                         in my--oh, and that Lincoln Memorial! 
                         Gee! There he is--Mr. Lincoln--looking 
                         right at you as you come up the steps--
                         sitting there like he was waiting 
                         for someone to come along--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well--he's got nothing on me.

               She turns away and starts for her hat and coat.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Now, if you're ready, Senator, we 
                         can start for the hotel. I'll *see* 
                         that you get there.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (with a laugh)
                         Yes--I think maybe you'd better.

               The scene dissolves to the interior of the TAXICAB with 
               JEFFERSON AND SAUNDERS, Jefferson looking out of the windows, 
               seeing what he can see, even though it's night; Saunders 
               giving him an impatient, martyred look.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (pointing out)
                         Whose statue is that?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I wouldn't know in the *day time*.

               Suddenly he leans over Saunders and points excitedly out her 
               side of the cab.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The Capitol Dome! Lighted up!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (gently pushing him 
                              off)
                         You--uh--you better relax, Senator. 
                         You'll be plumb wore out.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Tell me, Miss Saunders--what time 
                         does the Senate--uh--what do they 
                         call it?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Convene?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Convene--that's it--yes. I got to 
                         pick up some of those parliamentary 
                         words. I imagine a fellow can get 
                         pretty lost in the Senate without 
                         'em--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (more or less under 
                              her breath)
                         With or without 'em.
                              (Quickly)
                         Twelve--noon. The Senate convenes at 
                         twelve o'clock.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (breaking in--full of 
                              the idea)
                         Gosh--that'll be something! You know 
                         what I better do in the morning?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (wearily)
                         No. What had you better--?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Go out to Mount Vernon. It'd be a 
                         sort of fine thing to do--see 
                         Washington's home just before walking 
                         into the Senate for the first time--
                         don't you think?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (hollowly)
                         Oh--a wonderful thing--yes. Get you 
                         right in the mood--yes--yes.

               Just then, the cab pulls over toward the curb and Saunders 
               perks up.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh--and *here* we are, Senator! Well, 
                         well, well! At last!

               The cab stops and a uniformed doorman opens the cab door on 
               Jefferson's side.

               Now we see the HOTEL CURB, THE CAB, THE FOOTMAN, and JEFF 
               looking out of the cab. Coming out of the hotel is a party 
               in evening dress--white mufflered, top-hatted man--and women 
               in furs.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (impatiently)
                         After you. Do you mind?

               Jeff stares at the party, at the footman--then up at the 
               fifteen-story hotel.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (very impatiently)
                         This is *it*, Senator!

               In the CAB:

                                     JEFFERSON
                         No, gee--I couldn't stay here--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (amazed)
                         You *couldn't*?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I mean--gosh--I wouldn't be 
                         comfortable in a--I--I haven't got 
                         clothes and things like that--and--I 
                         couldn't keep pigeons *there*--No--I--
                         I just--just wouldn't be--

               And he pulls the cab door closed.

                                     DRIVER
                         Where to, Mister?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Where to, Miss Saunders?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (at the end of her 
                              patience)
                         Where? Why, the wide open spaces!

               The scene dissolves to a PHONE BOOTH, with SAUNDERS 
               telephoning.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (with emphasis)
                         --all I know is, he refused to go 
                         into your hotel, Senator Paine--and 
                         not having my lasso with me, I didn't 
                         know how to *make* him.

               In PAINE'S HOTEL APARTMENT, Paine is on the phone, with McGann 
               in the background.

                                     PAINE
                         What did you do? Where did he go?

               In the PHONE BOOTH:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well--finally--after a substantial 
                         tour of the city, he saw a sort of 
                         boarding house, built nice and close 
                         to the ground. That's what he wanted--
                         and that's where you're to send his 
                         bags--Eleven B Street, Northeast. Oh--
                         and don't forget the pigeons!

               In PAINE'S HOTEL APARTMENT:

                                     PAINE
                         And that's where you *left* him?

               In the PHONE BOOTH:

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (with weary sarcasm)
                         ...Oh, he's perfectly all right. 
                         Going to stay in and write to Ma 
                         tonight... Ma. Ma. Don't you know 
                         Ma? And then he'll take his swig of 
                         Castoria and go to sleep... I'd rather 
                         not think about the morning right 
                         now, if you don't mind. Goodnight, 
                         Senator!
                              (She hangs up)

               In PAINE'S HOTEL APARTMENT, Paine hangs up the phone.

                                     PAINE
                         Eleven B Street, Northeast. Take his 
                         bags and your own right over--and 
                         get yourself a room in the same place--

                                     MCGANN
                         Listen, Joe--at least--after a day 
                         like this--I got one good bust coming 
                         before I start showing him monuments--

               He is interrupted by Susan, who comes dashing in excitedly, 
               all dressed to go out.

                                     SUSAN
                         For heaven's sake--will someone please 
                         get those pigeons out of this 
                         apartment! They're smelling up the 
                         place something--

                                     MCGANN
                         Pigeons!

               The scene dissolves to a RESTAURANT BAR, with Saunders and 
               Diz hopped up on stools. Saunders is grimly and angrily 
               holding forth.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I'm still asking myself--what is he--
                         animal, vegetable, or mineral? A 
                         Senator! A United States Senator! I 
                         thought I'd seen everything but--
                         why, he doesn't know what time it 
                         is, Diz! When I think of myself 
                         sitting around--playing straight for 
                         all that phoney, patriotic chatter--
                         *me*, carrying bibs for an infant 
                         with little flags in his fists--no, 
                         I can't take it, Diz--I'm through--I 
                         quit!

                                     DIZ
                         Sure--sure--wait a minute now--simmer 
                         down--

               NOSEY, at this point, saunters up to the bar, his back to 
               Saunders.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (breaking out again)
                         Why--do you know what he's going to 
                         do before taking that Senate seat 
                         tomorrow? He's going to Mount Vernon--
                         to get into the mood--a *warm up*!

               Nosey swings around in a flash and pushes his face right in.

                                     NOSEY
                         Who? Who? Your boss! A nut, huh? A 
                         nut! Wow! There's a *story* in this 
                         guy--! I smelled it!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (impatient)
                         Go away, Nosey.

                                     NOSEY
                         Saunders--it's meat and drink--lemme 
                         at 'im! Five minutes--! I'll make it 
                         right with you!

                                     DIZ
                         Will you go chase an ambulance!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Whadaya mean--*right*?

                                     NOSEY
                         What do I *mean*, huh? Uh--*I'll* 
                         tell ya--World's Series--a pass! In 
                         a month it's worth fifteen bucks!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well, well!

                                     DIZ
                              (to Saunders)
                         Hey--you're not *talking* to this 
                         guy!

                                     NOSEY
                         Whadaya say?

                                     DIZ
                         Nothin'! Beat it!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Look, Nosey--your pals would like to 
                         get in on this, wouldn't they?

                                     NOSEY
                         Hey--I wanna *scoop*!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well, that's out. Either it's *lots* 
                         of reporters and *lots* of tickets 
                         or--. Now will you go and call 'em 
                         before I change my mind about the 
                         whole thing!

                                     NOSEY
                         Okay. See you here.

               He charges off. Saunders clambers down off the stool. Diz 
               grabs her arm.

                                     DIZ
                         Kid--wait--what do you think you're 
                         going to do?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Get my *whole* fall outfit--and quit 
                         this job in style!

                                     DIZ
                         Now, you've got more sense than to 
                         put Nosey onto this guy--!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (thinking hard)
                         Wait--wait. Let's see--watchdog McGann--
                         he's bound to move right in--get him 
                         out of the way first--
                              (Then)
                         Pardon me, friend--I've got some 
                         telephoning to do--!
                              (And she rushes off)

               The scene dissolves to a PHONE BOOTH, with SAUNDERS on the 
               phone.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (laying on a Southern 
                              accent)
                         Mr. McGann?... This is Miss Lulu 
                         Love.

               In MCGANN'S ROOM, MCGANN is on the phone; behind him, his 
               suitcases are open.

                                     MCGANN
                         Who?

               In the PHONE BOOTH:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh, you don't know *me*, Mr. McGann--
                         but I've seen *you* in Washington 
                         before--and I think you're awfully 
                         cute. Mr. Griffith told me you got 
                         in and maybe you were a little lonely--

               In MCGANN'S ROOM:

                                     MCGANN
                              (taking it big)
                         Did, huh? Well, now, he's not wrong 
                         at all... Tonight? Sister, that's 
                         just what the doctor ordered... Whoa, 
                         wait a minute--

               He looks off, and through a partly opened door leading into 
               Jeff's room. Jeff appears standing at the window with one of 
               his pigeons, while McGann is heard on the phone.

                                     MCGANN'S VOICE
                         I'm not sure I can make that, Lulu. 
                         Hold on a second, will you?
                              (He puts his hand 
                              over the mouthpiece, 
                              and calls out)
                         Say--Senator! How're you fixed--I 
                         mean--uh--you're gonna stay in and 
                         write to Ma and the boys, like you 
                         said, huh?

               In JEFF'S ROOM, JEFF is inserting a small roll of paper in a 
               little metal container on the pigeon's leg.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (without turning)
                         Uh-huh.

                                     MCGANN'S VOICE
                         Not going out or anything?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         No. Why?

               In MCGANN'S ROOM:

                                     MCGANN
                              (yelling to Jeff)
                         Atta boy. Right into bed for a nice 
                         long sleep. Me, too.
                              (Then--softly, into 
                              phone)
                         Okay, Toots! When and where?

               In the PHONE BOOTH, Saunders is still speaking.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (into the phone)
                         Now isn't that nice! Let's say the 
                         Mayflower lobby, Mr. McGann--in a 
                         half hour... What I *look* like? 
                         Well, I got red hair and--oh, that's 
                         all right--I know what *you* look 
                         like--you cute thing. Goodbye.
                              (She hangs up)

               In MCGANN'S ROOM, McGann hangs up, tiptoes over quickly and 
               closes the door to Jeff's room, then makes a dash for his 
               coat.

                                     MCGANN
                         Boy, oh, boy! Red Hair! McGann--you 
                         fell into something!

               The scene dissolves to the HOTEL LOBBY at night, and MCGANN 
               is seen watching for his date, but in JEFFERSON'S BOARDING 
               HOUSE SITTING ROOM there is a startling tableau: Jeff is 
               standing in the center of this rather homely, anciently 
               appointed sitting room, surrounded by ten or a dozen newspaper 
               men, three or four of whom have cameras. A woman reporter is 
               present. Nosey is leading the circus as the main interrogator 
               and master of ceremonies. Cameras are flashing, while 
               Jefferson is posing, pleased and happy and proud.

                                     VOICES
                         That's it. Right like that. Chin up 
                         a little, Senator--please. Hold it!

               Then the cameras relax and questions pop.

                                     VOICES
                         Tell us about yourself, Senator! 
                         Hear you got a Boy's Club back home! 
                         Any ideas? Going to make things hum 
                         in the Senate, huh?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (holding his hands 
                              up, laughing)
                         Hold on, fellows--I'm not used to 
                         more then one question at a time--

                                     NOSEY
                         One moment, friends, let's give the 
                         Senator a break.
                              (To Jeff)
                         Now, where'd you say you studied 
                         law?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--I haven't needed much law so 
                         far--what I'd like to get first is a 
                         little common sense--

                                     NOSEY
                         Swell!

                                     REPORTER
                         What did he say?

                                     NOSEY
                              (calling back)
                         You don't need law--you need *common* 
                         sense!

               Reporters make rapid notes.

                                     REPORTER
                         What are you going to do while you're 
                         here, Senator?

                                     NOSEY
                         Any special ax to grind?

                         A pet idea--you know--pension bill--

                         notion you think would be good for 
                         this country, haven't you?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--I have got *one* idea--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--for a couple of years now--I--
                         I've thought it would be a wonderful 
                         thing to have a National Boys' Camp 
                         out in our State--

                         A camp! Well!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You see--if we could take the poor 
                         kids off the streets--out of cities--
                         a few months in the summer--learn 
                         something about Nature and American 
                         ideals--

                                     NOSEY
                         Marvelous! And what would this camp 
                         set the Government back?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh--nothing--nothing. My idea is--
                         for the Government to lend us the 
                         money--and the boys'll pay it back--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--I haven't seen many--oh--well--
                         Miss Susan Paine--she's about the 
                         prettiest girl I--I *ever* saw--

                         Yeah! How about it? You're a nature 
                         lover. Do you handle any of that 
                         sign language?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--I can *manage*--

                                     ANOTHER REPORTER
                         What about bird calls! Know any?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--a few--

                                     VOICES
                         Swell! Well! Come right ahead! Let 
                         'em fly, Senator!

               As Jeff laughs, preparing to do his stuff--and as the cameras 
               are made ready--

               The scene dissolves to the HOTEL LOBBY. McGann, looking at 
               his watch, is sore as a boil by this time. Glaring off, his 
               attention is arrested. He starts forward. At the SWINGING 
               DOOR, a cute little girl has just come through and stands. 
               McGann marches up to her.

                                     MCGANN
                         Well! About time, toots! Redhead or 
                         no readhead--keeping a guy waiting 
                         two hours is no--
                              (Looking her over, 
                              relaxing, and grabbing 
                              her arm)
                         Good thing you're as cute as you 
                         are, or I'd--

                                     THE GIRL
                              (struggling)
                         Wally!

               A big six-footer, with football shoulders, comes swinging 
               in. The girl leaps to his side. McGann at once realizes a 
               hideous mistake has been made somewhere--and it's too late. 
               Wally fixes him with a deadly stare and advances to do murder. 
               McGann starts backing away in alarm as the scene dissolves 
               amid a dash of music.

               A NEWSPAPER FRONT PAGE come to view. It reveals a full-length 
               picture of Jeff, and then the caption:

                                  SENATOR (RANGER) SMITH
                               Demands More Common Sense--
                                  Less Law In Government

               This dissolves to ANOTHER HEADLINE:

                                      SMITH ATTACKS
                                   GOVERNMENT SPENDING
                               No Money Left for Boy's Camp

               In SAUNDER'S ROOM, Saunders is drinking her morning coffee--
               looking at the morning papers. She nearly chokes as she stares 
               at the paper.

               This scene dissolves to MCGANN'S ROOM, with McGann, half-
               dressed, one eye bandaged, staring at a paper. A NEWS PICTURE 
               comes to view, showing Jeff kneeling over a little fire of 
               sticks. The caption reads:

                                MAKES CAMP FIRE--SHOWS HOW
                              HE'LL PUT THE HEAT ON CONGRESS

               MCGANN, shirt-tails flying, tears for the door to Jeff's 
               room. It is empty.

                                     MCGANN
                         Senator! Hey--ranger!
                              (Clapping a hand to 
                              his forehead)
                         Gone again!

               The scene dissolves to a NEWSPAPER PICTURE of Jefferson 
               imitating a bird-call eyes bulging--while his two hands appear 
               to be gripping his nose as if warding off a bad odor. The 
               caption reads:

                                RANGER SENATOR GETS FIRST
                              "WHIFF" OF OFFICIAL WASHINGTON

               In the DINING ROOM OF PAINE'S HOTEL APARTMENT, Paine and 
               Susan are at breakfast, Paine's eyes glued wildly to the 
               paper; Susan also holds a paper and laughs.

                                     PAINE
                         His first 'whiff'!

                                     SUSAN
                         Such pretty knees for a big boy!

                                     PAINE
                         Do I actually *see* this--?

                                     SUSAN
                         Listen, Father! "Young Lochinvar 
                         smitten with Susan Paine"!

               The scene dissolves to PAINE'S PRIVATE OFFICE as Saunders 
               enters and Paine rises from behind his desk.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (belligerently)
                         You want to see me, Senator?

                                     PAINE
                         Yes. Good morning, Saunders.
                              (Picking up the 
                              newspaper; genially)
                         Have you--uh--any idea how this 
                         happened?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         The ranger's notices? No idea at 
                         all.

                                     PAINE
                              (with good humor)
                         No?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No--I'm sorry. I merely saw him home. 
                         I'm not supposed to tuck him in and 
                         give him his bottle. That's McGann's 
                         job.

                                     PAINE
                         By the way, Mr. McGann just phoned--
                         in a high fever. Smith's gone again. 
                         Have you any idea where?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes. He went to Mount Vernon to give 
                         himself a patriotic address.

                                     PAINE
                              (smiling)
                         Well--that's very fine.
                              (Then)
                         Saunders, some person in your office 
                         says you've quit--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         That's right.

                                     PAINE
                         Oh, now--that won't do--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Look, Senator--I wasn't given a brain 
                         just to tell a Boy Ranger what time 
                         it is. What do you need me for? Get 
                         somebody else--get a registered nurse--

                                     PAINE
                         You're the best nurse I can think of--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Nice *compliment*!

                                     PAINE
                         I meant it for one. I meant--Sam 
                         Foley couldn't get along without you--
                         and neither can I at the moment--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No?

                                     PAINE
                         You see--Governor Hopper made an 
                         appointment in this case that--well, 
                         Jeff isn't exactly fitted to the 
                         work, let's say. He's here to see 
                         monuments--and pass the time. That's 
                         important to--to my work--and 
                         everybody concerned. So, someone who 
                         can be trusted has to occupy him and 
                         keep him out of trouble--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         And I'm an old hand at following 
                         instructions--

                                     PAINE
                         You're more than that. I've had 
                         example of the fact that wild horses 
                         couldn't pull confidential matter in 
                         these two offices out of you. That's 
                         why I tell you what I do--about Smith 
                         and this situation. So, you see--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yeah--I see I'm right where I've 
                         been for seven years--

                                     PAINE
                         You deserve a lot better. And I'll 
                         tell you what we'll do. Stay and 
                         play nurse, as you say--and if certain 
                         things happen I'm taking everybody 
                         up with me, and you'll get one of 
                         the biggest jobs in Washington.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yeah?
                              (A pause)
                         And what else?

                                     PAINE
                         What do you mean?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well, when I first came to Washington, 
                         my eyes were big, blue question marks--
                         now they're big, green dollar marks--

                                     PAINE
                         I see. All right. You finish this 
                         job properly--and you get a handsome 
                         bonus besides--

               Saunder's face lights up with interest.

                                     PAINE'S VOICE
                         And by *properly* I mean--stay away 
                         with Smith every minute--keep him 
                         away from anything that smacks of 
                         politics--see that there's no 
                         recurrence of things like these 
                         newspapers--

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE LOBBY, an elevator corridor 
               leading to the Senate chamber. A CLOCK shows 11:45. Then, 
               Saunders and Jefferson are seen as they emerge from the 
               elevator and start forward. People crowd the corridor--there 
               is surging activity--an air of excitement. Jeff, baffled, 
               looking around, suddenly looks ahead and stops dead.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Saunders! That's it! We're here!

               In the SENATE CHAMBER, seen through the entrance doors, people 
               are seated in and entering galleries; Senators are walking, 
               standing in groups, talking; some are at their desks.

               On the FLOOR OF THE SENATE CHAMBER, a Page is leading 
               Jefferson to his desk. Jeff is more agape now than before. 
               All around him are Senators--in groups or seated. Most of 
               them are at their desks now. The Page brings him a desk, on 
               a minority side and way at the rear. Heads turn to follow 
               Jeff curiously.

                                     BOY
                         Here you are, Senator. Not a bad 
                         desk, either. Daniel Webster used to 
                         use it.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Daniel Webster? Sat here? Say--that 
                         man was a great orator.

                                     BOY
                         Give you something to shoot at, 
                         Senator--if you figure on doing any 
                         talking.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Not me, sonny. I'm just going to sit 
                         around and listen.
                              (Picking up calendar)
                         What's this?

                                     BOY
                         Calendar for the day. You'll find 
                         the Senate Manual in the drawer. 
                         Anything else you want, just snap 
                         for a page.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Where's the Majority Leader?

                                     BOY
                         The Majority Leader? Right over there. 
                         And that's [           ] the Minority 
                         Leader. They're both pretty good in 
                         the clinches.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Uh-huh. And where's the Press Galery?

                                     BOY
                         Right up there over the Vice-
                         President's chair--the four in the 
                         front row represent the four big 
                         news services. You've met the press 
                         bunch, haven't you?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, yes--they're fine people--regular 
                         people.

                                     BOY
                         Look out for those fellows--they 
                         tell the truth about you--sometimes. 
                         That corner over there is reserved 
                         for guides and sightseers who come 
                         in for five minutes to rest their 
                         feet. That section over there is 
                         reserved for Senator's friends. The 
                         front row--the empty one--is for the 
                         President and White House guests--
                         see that old couple over there--
                         they've attended every session for 
                         the last twenty years. Over the clock 
                         back here is the Diplomatic section. 
                         They and the page boys are the only 
                         real class we have in this place. 
                         The rest are mostly people who come 
                         here like they go to the zoo--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Those busts up there--all around the 
                         wall--who are they, sonny?

                                     BOY
                         All the ex-vice-Presidents. You can 
                         get ten-to-one around here if you 
                         think you can remember their names. 
                         The Vice-President presides over the 
                         Senate--you know that. It's how he 
                         earns his pay. Oh--over there, Senator--
                         on the east side of the Chair we 
                         still have the old snuff boxes with 
                         real snuff in them if you like snuff.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Thanks very much, sonny--

                                     BOY
                         I'll take your hat into the cloak 
                         room.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Here--let me give you a Boy Ranger 
                         button.

                                     BOY
                         Swell. Thanks very much.
                              (He takes Jeff's hand)
                         Good luck, Senator. Keep your left 
                         up.

               Jeff, looking up toward the Press Gallery, sees Saunders and 
               waves to her.

               PAINE comes to Jeff.

                                     PAINE
                         Hello, Jeff--sorry, I've been on a 
                         committee all morning. Got your 
                         credentials--when the Vice-President 
                         calls you, you go down that center 
                         aisle and I'll meet you there--he's 
                         about ready to come in now, Jeff. 
                         Good luck--

               Paine pats Jeff's shoulder and moves away. Senators are 
               separating and making for their seats. Jeff excitedly sits 
               down again.

               After a full view of the CHAMBER, showing people subsiding 
               into their seats all over the gallery, we see the gray, small 
               PRESIDENT of the Senate. He has a mild, humorful face. 
               Everything is in order in front of him as he looks out over 
               the body of the Senate and picks up the small ivory gavel-
               head. His eyes look off intently at something. He raises his 
               gavel a the long hand of the CLOCK that comes to view jumps 
               to twelve o'clock exactly. Two gavel pounds are heard.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (pounding twice again)
                         The Senate will come to order!

               The body is lulled, though a few members are walking to their 
               desks. Then the Senator occupying the desk traditionally 
               used by the majority leader (front and center and on the 
               right side of the aisle) rises.

                                     MAJORITY LEADER
                         Mr. President.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Senator Agnew.

                                     MAJORITY LEADER
                         I ask unanimous consent that the 
                         reading of the journal of the previous 
                         calendar day be dispensed with and 
                         the journal stand approved.
                              (He sits)

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (bored, mechanically)
                         Is there objection?
                              (A pause)
                         The journal stands approved.

               JEFFERSON is seen in close view, his attention darting from 
               one point to the other.

                                     SENATOR'S VOICE
                         Mr. President...

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         Senator Brownell.

                                     SENATOR'S VOICE
                         I suggest the absence of a quorum.

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         The clerk will call the roll.

               At the ROSTRUM, the Chief Clerk proceeds to call the roll 
               and Senator's voices answer to their names--"here" or 
               "present."

               The Clerk is next seen passing up the roll sheet to the 
               President, who looks at it.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Eighty Senators have answered to 
                         their names. A quorum is present.

               Paine rises.

                                     PAINE
                         Mr. President...

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Senator Paine.

                                     PAINE
                         I present the credentials of Honorable 
                         Jefferson Smith who has just been 
                         appointed Senator by the Governor of 
                         my state.

               A page takes the credentials from Paine's hand and takes 
               them to the desk.

                                     PAINE
                         The Senator-designate is present--

               JEFFERSON looks startled.

                                     PAINE'S VOICE
                         ...and I ask that the oath of office 
                         be administered to him at this time.

               The PRESIDENT is picking up what are evidently Jefferson's 
               credentials.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         If the Senator-designate will present 
                         himself at the desk, the oath will 
                         be administered.

               JEFFERSON, swallowing, frightened, is glued to his seat for 
               an instant. People in the Gallery and the Senate turn to 
               look for him; among them are Saunders and, in the Press 
               Section, Diz. A few of the Senators consult the newspapers 
               on their desks, significantly.

               PAINE rises, motioning to Jefferson to get to his feet, and 
               JEFFERSON, on seeing him, gets up unsteadily. Paine starting 
               to the back, indicating that he is to follow him, Jefferson 
               advances to the rear of the center aisle where Paine is now 
               waiting for him. Then both of them start down the aisle toward 
               the Rostrum--while the people (including Saunders, the Press, 
               and groups of Senators) watch them advance, some of the 
               Senators appearing tight-lipped and disapproving. Aware of 
               the eyes on him, JEFFERSON, in the company of PAINE, arrives 
               at the lower level of the Rostrum, while the people of the 
               press rise to look over their desks at the ceremony. Then 
               Paine indicates to Jefferson to mount one more step to the 
               level just below the President's desk. But as Jefferson makes 
               the designated step up, and the President is about to rise, 
               a voice cracks out from somewhere out in the Chamber.

                                     SENATOR'S VOICE
                         Mr. President! I rise to a question 
                         of order!

               All turn to the Senator who has risen. Jefferson, standing 
               before the President, turns to look back.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         The gentleman will state it.

                                     SENATOR
                              (who is now seen in 
                              close view)
                         I seek to ascertain, Mr. President, 
                         if the gentleman about to be sworn 
                         in is fully aware of the 
                         responsibilities of his high office--
                         and that the members of this body 
                         strive to conduct themselves at all 
                         times--

               We see JEFFERSON, his puzzlement deepening as he hears the 
               Senator.

                                     SENATOR'S VOICE
                         --with dignity and sincerity.

               The SENATOR is seen gesturing with a newspaper.

                                     SENATOR
                         I refer to his astounding and 
                         shameless performance for the 
                         newspapers this morning.

               PAINE is seen wincing (he knew this was coming) as he listens.

                                     SENATOR'S VOICE
                         A *versatile* performance, I grant 
                         you--

               There are titters from all over the house. The PRESIDENT 
               brings the gavel down, and looks up at the gallery.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Order in the chamber.

                                     SENATOR
                              (while the entire 
                              chamber is visible)
                         --but one that brings his rank down 
                         to the level of a side-show 
                         entertainer--and reflects on the 
                         sincerity, if not the *sanity*, of 
                         the highest body of lawmakers in the 
                         land!
                              (Waving the paper)
                         I seek to learn if this is the 
                         gentleman's conception of the nature 
                         of his office!

               JEFF turns impulsively to the PRESIDENT.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I don't understand, sir! I don't 
                         know what the gentleman--

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (banging gavel)
                         The Senator has no voice in this 
                         chamber until the oath of office has 
                         been administered!

                                     PAINE
                         Mr. President! I will answer the 
                         gentleman! My colleague was innocent 
                         in the matter referred to. He was 
                         completely misquoted. I *know* 
                         Jefferson Smith--and I will *vouch* 
                         for it--he has the greatest possible 
                         respect for his office and for these 
                         gentlemen.

                                     A SENATOR'S VOICE
                         Mr. President!

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (eyes on Jefferson 
                              with sympathy; bangs 
                              gavel)
                         The swearing in of the Senator-
                         designate is the order of business!
                              (He rises. The chamber 
                              is in full view)
                         The gentleman will raise his right 
                         hand and repeat after me the following 
                         oath--

               Jefferson does as bid. The President recites the oath, and 
               Jefferson repeats after him:

                                     PRESIDENT
                         "I do solemnly swear--that I will 
                         support and defend the Constitution 
                         of the United States--against all 
                         enemies, foreign and domestic--that 
                         I will bear true faith and allegiance 
                         to the same--that I take this 
                         obligation freely--without and mental 
                         reservation and purpose of evasion--
                         and that I will well and faithfully 
                         discharge the duties of the office 
                         on which I am about to enter. So 
                         help me God."

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (finishing)
                         "So help me God."

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Senator, you can talk all you want 
                         to, now.

               The President shakes hands with Jefferson. Paine shakes his 
               hand, then, guides him down one step to the clerk where 
               Jefferson, dazed, understands that he is to sign the register. 
               Then Jefferson and Paine start back up the center aisle, all 
               eyes following them, and ripples of laughter breaking out 
               from all over the Chamber.

               JEFFERSON is seen making his way back up the aisle. Suddenly 
               he snatches up a paper from a desk he passes, and his eyes 
               fasten on the headlines. He continues to walk, reading--his 
               jaw muscles tightening--then he looks up into the Press 
               gallery.

               The scene now dissolves to a MONTAGE, first the headlines 
               appearing over Jeff's incredulous expression as he reads. He 
               starts walking--hands clenched, murder in his eye--he meets 
               a reporter of the night before, grabs him, socks him and 
               marches on. He meets another one in a different place--socko 
               again! Finally he smacks Nosey--and marches on--. Next we 
               see a pair of DOORS, on which is printed "Press Club," and 
               when these doors are pushed aside violently the PRESS CLUB 
               BAR is visible as Jeff stands glaring. Newspaper men are at 
               the bar and at tables ranged along the wall. Conversation--
               smoke. Sweeney, Farrell, Flood, Summers and Diz are there--
               and Nosey.

               NOSEY appears with Diz and Sweeney, at one of the tables.

                                     NOSEY
                         He's on a rampage. The streets aren't 
                         safe. I came up here to--
                              (Looking toward door 
                              suddenly)
                         Oh-oh. Tarzan!

               Heads turn in that direction, as Jeff starts toward Nosey. 
               When he gets within five steps, he suddenly lunges forward 
               and grabs him. He draws his right hand back to hit--the boys 
               leap in--and a free-for-all is on. Chairs and tables go over. 
               Finally, Jeff is swarmed under--down on his back on the long 
               seat against the wall while Nosey is under a table.

                         Whoa, now... 
                         Wait a minute... 
                         Take it easy, Senator... 
                         We don't go in for slugging around 
                         here... 
                         If you can behave yourself now...

               Jeff stop struggling.

                                     NOSEY
                              (from under a table)
                         Meet Senator Smith, boys.

               They pile off Jeff--who sits up slowly, looking the worse 
               for wear. His pugnacity is gone, and he is calm, hurt and 
               bitter.

                                     SWEENEY

                         "What *is* truth?" asked so-and-so, 
                         and turned away!

                         That's what I said--the *truth*!

                         sit down--. We'll see what we can 
                         do.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         There isn't a chance I'd find it 
                         here!

                         Yes? And the people of this country

                         the Senate--

               Jeff makes a leap for Diz.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Why, you--!

               The men are on him and push him back.

               As the last crack hits, Jeff gets to his feet like a shot, 
               as if ready to kill. The men stand firm and Jeff stops dead. 
               He glares around; they stare back in contempt. Jeff's anger 
               flows away. He finally says quietly:

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (after a pause)
                         Good day--gentlemen.

               And he starts grimly for the door--the men falling aside 
               quietly to let him through.

               The scene dissolves to PAINE'S LIVING ROOM, with JEFFERSON 
               speaking tensely to PAINE.

                         In your time here, you couldn't even 
                         start on those Bills. They're put 
                         together by legal minds--after a 
                         long study. Why, after twenty years, 
                         I can't understand half of them

                         to the papers about wanting to create 
                         a National Boys' camp? Were you in 
                         earnest about that?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, I was--

                                     PAINE
                         Well, why not do it? There's a job 
                         for you. Get a Bill started to 
                         accomplish it--present it to Congress--
                         it would be a great experience--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Senator Paine, if I could do just 
                         that one thing while I'm here, I--
                         I'd feel that I--

                                     PAINE
                         What's to stop you? Saunders will 
                         help you with it--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (elatedly)
                         I will, sir! I will!
                              (Taking Paine's hand)
                         I--I don't know how to thank you. I 
                         knew, if any man could help me--

                                     PAINE
                         Nonsense, Jeff.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Thank you, sir. Thank you for your 
                         time.

                                     PAINE
                         Here--where are you running off to?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well, I'm sort of anxious to get 
                         back to the office--

               Susan, looking quite ravishing, appears suddenly.

                                     SUSAN
                         Father--oh.

                                     PAINE
                         Jefferson dropped in for a minute, 
                         Susan.

                                     SUSAN
                              (with a distinct lack 
                              of emotion)
                         How nice. How do you do, Senator?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (dry-mouthed; his 
                              eyes fastened on the 
                              lovely creature)
                         How--how do you do, Miss Paine?
                              (With reference to 
                              his clothes)
                         I--I apologize for looking like this--
                         I--I have to be going now--

                                     SUSAN
                         How are the pigeons?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Fine--they're fine.
                              (Then suddenly)
                         Oh, Miss Paine, I--I want to apologize--
                         what the papers said I said about 
                         you--that wasn't true. I--I would 
                         never say a thing like that.

                                     SUSAN
                              (with tongue in cheek)
                         Did you hear, Father? He didn't mean 
                         it when he said I was beautiful.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh--you are!

                                     SUSAN
                         Then you *did* say it.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         No--I mean--yes--that is--

               In a great perspiring fuss, he drops the subject like a hot 
               coal, comes to Paine quickly and seizes his hand.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well, goodbye, sir--and thank you 
                         again.
                              (Starting to back 
                              toward the foyer as 
                              he speaks to Susan)
                         Well--it--it was nice seeing you, 
                         Miss Paine--

                                     SUSAN
                         Goodnight, Senator--

               Jeff is still backing.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Goo-goodnight, Miss Paine.
                              (To Paine again)
                         Goodnight, sir--goodnight.

               And at this point he backs right into a delicate side-table 
               with a lamp on it. Table and lamp go down with a crash.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Gosh! Darn!

               He scrambles to pick up the table and lamp. There's been no 
               damage.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (as he picks things 
                              up)
                         I'm sorry! Gee! I hope--

                                     PAINE
                         That's all right, my boy--don't bother--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Gosh!
                              (Straightens lamp on 
                              table)
                         Well--looks good as new. If there 
                         *is* any damage, I'll--

                                     PAINE
                              (laughing)
                         Good as new! It's quite all right--

               Jeff starts backing into the foyer again.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--goodnight.

                                     PAINE
                         Goodnight, Jeff.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Goodnight, Miss Paine.

                                     SUSAN
                         *Goodnight*!

               Jeff turns like a rabbit and heads for the hall door. We 
               hear it slam. Susan laughs loudly. Paine looks toward the 
               foyer thoughtfully.

                                     PAINE
                              (reflectively)
                         Well, at the expense of some of the 
                         furniture, Susan--you've made another 
                         conquest.

                                     SUSAN
                         What! Not Ol' Honest Abe!

                                     PAINE
                         And Honest Abe's ideals. A rare man--
                         these days.

               The scene dissolves to JEFF'S OUTER OFFICE, at night, with 
               Saunders at her desk, as McGann comes charging in, perspired 
               and bothered.

                                     MCGANN
                         Well! Hear anything? Any sign of 
                         him?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         How'd you like a punch in the nose?

                                     MCGANN
                              (startled)
                         What! Who?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         That's what he's been doing since 
                         last heard from.

                                     MCGANN
                         Whaddaya mean! What did *I* have to 
                         do with it? I don't blame the guy.
                              (Sinking into chair, 
                              exhausted)
                         Wow! Twenty-four hours in this town 
                         and nothing but dog-fights! And things 
                         aren't bad enough--last night I have 
                         to get a run-around from some wise 
                         dame--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (innocently, slipping 
                              over a southern accent)
                         My, my--you sho' are pahwerfully 
                         upset, Mister McGann--but you' awfully 
                         cute.

                                     MCGANN
                         Yeah? Well, when I get my hands on a 
                         red-headed doll with a southern lingo, 
                         I'll--

               He breaks off--her southern accent just sinking through. The 
               look he throws is quietly terrific. At this instant, a lively, 
               whistled rendition of "Dixie"--out in the corridor--breaks 
               in on them.

               As the door is swung open, JEFF bursts in, marching in step 
               to his spirited whistle. He marches right up to the astounded 
               Saunders and McGann--and finishes his whistle with a flourish.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (in high spirits)
                         You should hear our Ranger Band rattle 
                         that off--if you want to *hear* 
                         something! Good evening, Miss 
                         Saunders. Good evening Mister McGann.

                                     MCGANN
                              (finding his voice)
                         H'ya, Senator. I--I've sorta been 
                         looking for you--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You have?
                              (Then--quickly)
                         Will you come in a minute, Miss 
                         Saunders.

               He starts for the private office.

                                     MCGANN
                         Uh--Senator--I thought you and me 
                         might go out to dinner together--and 
                         grab off a few monuments.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, I couldn't tonight. Thanks a 
                         lot.

               Saunders follows Jeff.

               In JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE: he enters, marching to his desk. 
               Saunders comes slowly toward him, after closing the door.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Go ahead--punch.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Punch?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I had a lot to do with that little 
                         press conference last night--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (excitedly)
                         Well, then, I--I *thank* you, Miss 
                         Saunders! Nothing better could have 
                         happened--. Yes *sir*, Miss Saunders, 
                         we're going right ahead with it!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         We're going right ahead with--*what*?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Why, the Bill--the Bill--to make a 
                         National Boys' Camp...

                                     SAUNDERS
                         One moment, Senator. Do I understand 
                         you're going to present a *Bill*?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Sure! A Bill. Senator Paine and I 
                         decided it was the one way in the 
                         world I could make myself--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Pardon me. Senator Paine decided 
                         this *with* you?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes. Sure. It was his idea. *I* should 
                         have been the one to think of it--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         My dear Senator, have you the faintest 
                         idea of what it takes to get a Bill 
                         passed?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I know--but you--you're going to 
                         help.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         If I were *triplets*, I couldn't--. 
                         Look, Senator--let me give you a 
                         rough idea. A member has a Bill in 
                         mind--like you--a camp. Right?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Right.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Fine. Now, what does he do? He's got 
                         to sit down first and write it up. 
                         The where, when, why, how--and 
                         everything else. That takes time--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, but this one is so simple.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I see. *This* one is so simple--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         And with your help--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh, yes. And *I'm* helping. Simple--
                         and I'm helping. So we knock this 
                         off in record-breaking time of--let's 
                         say three or four days--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, just a day--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         A *day*!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Tonight.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Tonight.
                              (Controlling herself 
                              in a quiet burn)
                         Look--uh--I don't want to seem to be 
                         complaining, Senator--but in all 
                         civilized countries, there's an 
                         institution called *dinner*--!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (laughing a little)
                         Oh--dinner. Yes. Well, I'm hungry, 
                         too. I thought--maybe--we could have 
                         something brought in--you know, like 
                         big executives who eat off trays. 
                         You see, we've got to light into 
                         this and get it going--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Uh-huh. Well, dinner comes in on 
                         trays. We're executives. And we light 
                         into this. It is dawn. Your Bill is 
                         ready. You go over there and introduce 
                         it--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         How?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You get to your feet in the Senate 
                         and present it. Then you take the 
                         Bill and put it in a little box--
                         like a letter box--on the side of 
                         the rostrum. Just hold it between 
                         thumb and forefinger and drop it in. 
                         Clerks read it and refer it to the 
                         right committee--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Committee, huh?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Committee.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Why?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         That's how Congress--or any large 
                         body--is run. All work has to be 
                         done by committee.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Why?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Look--committees--small groups of 
                         Senators--have to sift a Bill down--
                         look into it--study it--and report 
                         to the whole Senate. You can't take 
                         a Bill no one knows anything about 
                         and discuss it among ninety-six men. 
                         Where would you get?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, I see that.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Good. Where are we?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Some committee's got it.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes. They give it to a *sub*-
                         committee, where they really give it 
                         a going over--hold hearings--call in 
                         people and ask questions--then report 
                         back to the bigger committee--where 
                         it's considered some more, changed, 
                         amended, or whatever. Days are going 
                         by, Senator. Days--weeks. Finally, 
                         they think it's quite a Bill. It 
                         goes over to the House of 
                         Representatives for debate and a 
                         vote. *But* it's got to wait its 
                         turn on the calendar--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Calendar?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         That's the order of business. Your 
                         Bill has to stand *way* back there 
                         in line unless the Steering Committee 
                         decides it is important enough to be--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         What's that?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The Steering Committee.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (depressed)
                         Do you really think we're getting 
                         anywhere.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes. Sure. What's a Steering 
                         Committee?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         A committee of the majority party 
                         leaders. They decide when a Bill is 
                         important enough to be moved up toward 
                         the head of the list--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         *This* is.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Pardon me--*this* is. Where are we 
                         now?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         We're over in the House.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes. House. More amendments--more 
                         changes--and the Bill goes back to 
                         the Senate--and *waits its turn on 
                         the calendar again*. The Senate 
                         doesn't like what the house did to 
                         the Bill. They make more changes. 
                         The House doesn't like *those* 
                         changes. Stymie. So they appoint men 
                         from each house to go into a huddle 
                         called a conference and battle it 
                         out. Besides that, all the lobbyists 
                         interested give cocktail parties for 
                         and against--government departments 
                         get in their two cents' worth--cabinet 
                         members--budget bureaus--embassies. 
                         Finally, if the Bill is alive after 
                         all this vivisection, it comes to a 
                         vote. Yes, sir--the big day finally 
                         arrives. And--nine times out of ten, 
                         they vote it down.
                              (Taking a deep breath)
                         Are you catching on, Senator?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes. Shall we start on it right now--
                         or order dinner first?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (mouth drops open)
                         Pardon?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I said--shall we get started *now* 
                         or--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (weakly)
                         Yes--sure. Why not?
                              (Then, very tired)
                         You don't mind if I take the time to 
                         get a pencil?

               She turns mechanically and heads for the outer office.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (calling after her--
                              laughing in high 
                              spirits)
                         No! Go right ahead, Miss Saunders.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Thanks very much.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         And a *lot* of paper!

               As Jefferson starts picking up the telegrams and reading 
               them avidly, Saunders goes out. In the OUTER OFFICE, McGann 
               jumps up as Saunders goes to her desk to pick up paper and 
               pencils, which she does mechanically.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I wouldn't wait if I were you.

                                     MCGANN
                         What do you mean? What's going on?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         The Head Man's writing a Bill.

                                     MCGANN
                         A Bill! Not *him*!

               Saunders silently gathers pencils and paper. She starts back 
               toward the Private Office.

                                     MCGANN
                              (calling after her)
                         What does he want to--? What's *he* 
                         doing writing a Bill?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (without stopping--
                              giving it the Southern 
                              accent again)
                         Why, he's a Senator, isn't he? I'm 
                         surprised at you, Mister McGann--
                              (and she passes into 
                              the Private Office)

               McGann is a man fit to be tied. Suddenly he lunges for his 
               hat and starts out quickly into the corridor.

               The scene dissolves to the exterior of PAINE'S HOTEL as Paine 
               and Susan, dressed for the evening--and in the company of 
               three other people (an elderly gentleman, a second man and a 
               middle-aged woman), are entering a limousine waiting at the 
               curb. A newsman, with camera, is running alongside Paine.

                                     NEWSMAN
                         Do you mind, Senator? I'd like a 
                         picture.

               Paine stops before the limousine, as the others get inside. 
               The photographer gets set. Before he can snap it, McGann 
               rushes up.

                                     MCGANN
                              (in a breathless 
                              whisper)
                         Joe--drop everything and come with 
                         me!

                                     PAINE
                         What's the matter?

                                     NEWSMAN
                              (motioning McGann 
                              aside)
                         Do you mind?

                                     MCGANN
                              (to Paine)
                         Smith--do you know what he's doing?--
                         writing Bills!

                                     PAINE
                         Yes, I know. I told him to.
                              (Putting McGann aside)
                         Pardon me, Charles. We're late to an 
                         Embassy dinner--

               The photographer gets his shot, and Chick leaps back to Paine.

                                     MCGANN
                         Joe! You *told* him to!

                                     PAINE
                         Yes--a camp bill that will never get 
                         beyond a first reading. So calm down, 
                         Chick--and--goodnight.

               Paine gets into the limousine--and the door closes.

                                     MCGANN
                         Joe! Jim said--*monuments*!

               The car pulls out--and McGann is left on the curb.

               The scene dissolves to JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE at night, 
               revealing SAUNDERS AND JEFFERSON. Saunders is against one 
               end of the desk with papers before her; Jefferson, his coat 
               off, is walking in circles--in the throes of creating his 
               bill.

               (Dinner trays, with empty dinner dishes on them, are in 
               evidence.)

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (in a brown study)
                         --that's the main idea, Miss Saunders. 
                         The United States Government isn't 
                         going to buy or build this camp--
                         just lend us the money. You've made 
                         a note of that, huh?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes, Senator--*twice*.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (walking circles)
                         Uh--have you?
                              (Running his hand 
                              through his hair)
                         Did you ever have so much to say 
                         about something--you couldn't say 
                         it?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (dryly)
                         Try sitting down.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I did--and--and I got right up.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Now, let's get down to particulars. 
                         How big is this thing? Where is it 
                         to be? How many boys will it take 
                         care of? If they're going to buy it--
                         how do they make their contributions? 
                         Your Bill has to have all that in it--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         And something else, too, Miss Saunders--
                         the spirit of it--the idea--the--

               In his walk, he has come to the window. He points out 
               suddenly.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         That's what's got to be in it.

               She looks in that direction, and sees the lighted CAPITOL 
               DOME, as seen through the window--with JEFFERSON in the 
               foreground.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (pointing)
                         That.

               SAUNDERS indicates that she sees the Dome, her eyebrows 
               lifting a little.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (quietly--with only a 
                              touch of sarcasm)
                         On paper?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (still looking out of 
                              the window, not 
                              conscious of her 
                              cynical question)
                         I want to make that come to life--
                         yes, and lighted up like that, too--
                         for every boy in the land. Boys forget 
                         what their country means--just reading 
                         "land of the free" in history books. 
                         And they get to be men--and forget 
                         even more. Liberty is too precious 
                         to get buried in books, Miss Saunders. 
                         Men ought to hold it up in front of 
                         them--every day of their lives and 
                         say: "I am free--to think--to speak. 
                         My ancestors couldn't. I can. My 
                         children will."

               And we see SAUNDERS looking at Jefferson with a new expression--
               listening rather raptly--then starting to make rapid notes.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         The boys ought to grow up 
                         *remembering* that.

               He breaks off--turns from the window--collecting himself out 
               of a daze--and a little embarrassed.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--gosh--that--that isn't 
                         "particulars," is it?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         But you've just taken care of the 
                         spirit all right.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well, anyway, it's *something* like 
                         that--
                              (Then--impulsively)
                         And it *is* important. That--that 
                         Steering Committee has *got* to see 
                         it that way. And I'm sure Senator 
                         Paine will do all he can--
                              (Breaking off)
                         He's a fine man, Miss Saunders, isn't 
                         he? He knew my father, you know.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         He did?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         We need a lot like him--his kind of 
                         character--ideals.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (dropping her head to 
                              the paper)
                         Uh--getting back to this, Senator--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, yes--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Now, this camp is going to be out in 
                         your state, of course--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (with enthusiasm)
                         About two hundred of the most 
                         beautiful acres that ever were! 
                         Mountains, prairie land, trees, 
                         streams! A paradise for boys who 
                         live in stuffy cities--
                              (Breaking off)
                         You don't know that country out there, 
                         do you, Miss Saunders?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I've been over every foot of it. You 
                         couldn't have any idea. You'd have 
                         to see for yourself--
                              (gazing off, enraptured)
                         --the prairies--the wind leaning on 
                         the tall grass--

               SAUNDERS is seen again, raptly watching him.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         --lazy streams down in the meadows--
                         and angry little midgets of water up 
                         in the mountains--
                              (again seen, together 
                              with SAUNDERS)
                         --cattle moving down a slope against 
                         the sun--camp-fires--snowdrifts...
                              (Breaking off)
                         Everybody ought to have *some* of 
                         that--*some* time in his life. My 
                         father taught me to see those things. 
                         He grew up with our state--an' he 
                         used to say to me, "Son, don't miss 
                         the wonders that surround you. Every 
                         tree, every sunset, every ant-hill 
                         and star is filled with the wonders 
                         of nature." He used to say, "Haven't 
                         you ever noticed how grateful you 
                         are to see daylight again after going 
                         through a dark tunnel?" "Well," he'd 
                         say, "open your eyes and always see 
                         life around you as if you'd just 
                         come out of a long tunnel."
                              (Then)
                         Where did *you* come from. Miss 
                         Saunders?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (quietly)
                         Well--I guess I've been in that tunnel 
                         all my life.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You mean--here?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Baltimore. Pure city-dweller.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         But you've had beautiful country all 
                         around you. You've just had to life 
                         up your eyes!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         City-dwellers never do that--for 
                         fear of what might drop *in* 'em.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (observing her a second)
                         Have you always had to--work?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Since sixteen or so.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I take it your--your parents couldn't--
                         uh--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No, they couldn't. Father was a 
                         doctor. The kind who placed ethics 
                         above collections. That speaks well 
                         for Father but it always left us 
                         kind of--
                              (Then)
                         Could we get on with this, Senator?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         It hasn't been easy, has it?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No complaints.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         But--I mean--for a woman--And--you've 
                         done awfully well--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Have I?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I never met anyone more--more 
                         intelligent--or capable. I--I don't 
                         know where I'd be on this bill of 
                         mine without your help--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I don't see where we are *with* it.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (jumping)
                         No! Gosh! I better get moving here, 
                         Miss Saunders--
                              (Suddenly)
                         Everybody else calls you just plain 
                         "Saunders." Why can't I?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Go right ahead.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Saunders. That's better.
                              (Practicing)
                         Good morning, Saunders. Hello, 
                         Saunders. How's the bill coming, 
                         Saunders--?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (permitting herself a 
                              laugh)
                         Terrible, thank you.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yeah. Yeah. Well, anyway, we've got 
                         "Saunders" settled. Maybe that was 
                         my trouble all along.
                              (Rubbing his hands)
                         YEs, *sir*. I'm all ready to go now--
                              (Then--suddenly)
                         What's your *first* name?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Why?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--nobody calls you anything but 
                         Saunders.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I also answer to whistles.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You--you've *got* a first name, 
                         haven't you?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Look--I think we ought to skip it.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         All right. Sure. Just curious. The 
                         picture popped into my mind all of a 
                         sudden of a pump without a handle--
                         or something--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well, if it's all the same to you--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (kidding her)
                         I know. It's--Violet.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         It *is* not!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Abigail.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Letitia.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Lena.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (laughing)
                         No! Stop it!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I've got more. You better tell me.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You win. It's--Clarissa.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (dashed down a little)
                         Clarissa. Oh. Uh-huh.
                              (Then)
                         Well, Saunders--let's go--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Now, *Susan*--that's really a *pretty* 
                         name--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (rising to the bait)
                         Susan! Susan Paine--that's beautiful--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         And a beautiful woman, too--don't 
                         you think?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes. The most beautiful I think I 
                         ever--gee--
                              (Catching himself--
                              leaping into action)
                         Say--we're *never* going to finish 
                         this thing! Now, here we go, Saunders. 
                         I'm going to talk faster'n you can 
                         write--

               Jefferson walks around rapidly. He is off at great speed 
               now.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The location of the camp. About two 
                         hundred acres situated in Ambrose 
                         County--Terry Canyon--

               SAUNDERS is seen busily writing down the facts.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         --running about a quarter of a mile 
                         on either side of Willet Creek--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (suddenly--sharply)
                         On either side of--*what*?

               Jefferson pauses--a little astonished at her sharp question.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (seen with SAUNDERS 
                              again)
                         Uh--Willet Creek. It's just a little 
                         stream--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         In Terry Canyon?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You--don't know it, do you?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (quickly)
                         No--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You couldn't. You've never been out 
                         there, you said.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (quickly again)
                         No, I haven't. I guess I thought the 
                         name was familiar.
                              (Then)
                         By the way, you discussed with Senator 
                         Paine where the camp was to be 
                         situated and everything?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Well--no. I didn't. Why?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Nothing. I just wondered. No *reason* 
                         to take it up with him.
                              (Reading from pad)
                         "--about a quarter of a mile on either 
                         side of Willet Creek--"

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (picking up again)
                         Yeah. This land to be bought by 
                         contributions from the boys. You 
                         have that. Money to be--

               Saunders, writing, looks up at Jefferson from under her brows 
               with growing interest.

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE CHAMBER, with the Senate 
               in session and the President speaking:

                                     PRESIDENT
                         --the chair lays before the Senate a 
                         communication from the Secretary of 
                         State, in response to Senate 
                         resolution 343.

               The communication is handed to the clerk, who begins to read.

               In the PRESS GALLERY we see SAUNDERS with DIZ, Saunders 
               smiling down on the floor as the clerk's voice is heard.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Sit tight, Diz. The show commences 
                         in just a minute.

                                     DIZ
                         What show? Would you mind telling me 
                         what's coming off here?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Certainly.
                              (Pointing down to the 
                              floor)
                         Now there's the principal actor in 
                         our little play.

               In the SENATE CHAMBER, JEFFERSON is grasping the bill tightly 
               in his hand--nervously, perspiringly waiting. He smiles up 
               at Saunders and waves the bill. The Clerk's voice is heard.

               In the PRESS GALLERY, Saunders smiles back at Jeff.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (to Diz)
                         Don Quixote--with bill.

               Diz doesn't make anything of this. Saunders glances off--and 
               points.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Ah. One of the supporting characters.

                                     DIZ
                         Who?

               In the VISITOR'S GALLERY MCGANN is seen listening to the 
               proceedings.

               In the PRESS GALLERY:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         That gorilla in Man's clothing--
                         McGann.

                                     DIZ
                         Oh, you mean--Puss in Boots.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes. Mostly "Puss."
                              (Pointing to the floor 
                              again)
                         Oh, the *other* prominent character 
                         in the play.

               In the CHAMBER, PAINE is seen listening to the clerk.

               In the PRESS GALLERY:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         The Silver Knight. Soul of Honor--on 
                         a tight-rope.

                                     DIZ
                         What do I play?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You play--left field.

                                     DIZ
                         Frankly, kid--are you goofy?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Diz--Don Quixote with bill is going 
                         to get to his feet in a minute and 
                         speak two important words--*Willet 
                         Creek*. When that happens--if my 
                         hunch is right--the Silver Knight 
                         will fall off his tightrope and Puss 
                         will jump out of his boots.

               In the CHAMBER, the Clerk finishes what he has been reading.

                                     A SENATOR
                         Mr. President--I ask that the 
                         communication be referred to Committee 
                         on Foreign Relations and printed.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         It is so ordered.
                              (Then)
                         Introduction of bills--

               JEFFERSON is seen in close view, his head jerking up.

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         --and joint resolutions.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (leaping to his feet, 
                              and yelling loudly)
                         Mr. President!

               The PRESIDENT is startled by the yell and a GROUP OF SENATORS 
               is seen turning around, also startled. In a portion of the 
               VISITOR'S GALLERY, people begin to titter--then laugh. The 
               gavel raps for order.

               JEFFERSON, aware that he has caused a stir by his shout, is 
               embarrassed as the gavel continues rapping. PAINE is mildly 
               amused. But in the VISITOR'S GALLERY, MCGANN, tight-lipped, 
               is shaking his head. He doesn't like this.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (with a smile)
                         The chair recognizes the rather strong-
                         lunged junior Senator, Mr. Smith.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (almost in a whisper)
                         I--I'm sorry, sir. I--I have a bill--

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         You may speak a little louder, 
                         Senator, but not too loud.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I have a bill to propose, sir.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Order, gentlemen. Our junior Senator 
                         is about to make a speech. You may 
                         proceed, Senator.

               With trembling, fumbling hands, Jefferson gets his paper up 
               before him.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (reading)
                         "Be it enacted by the Senate and the 
                         House of Representatives that there 
                         be appointed as a loan--"

               In the PRESS GALLERY, Saunders nudges Diz to watch McGann 
               and Paine.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         "--a sum sufficient to create a 
                         National Boys' Camp--"

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (again visible)
                         "--to be paid back to the United 
                         States Treasury by contributions 
                         from the boys of America. This Camp 
                         to be situated on the land at and 
                         adjacent to the head waters of the 
                         stream known as Willet Creek in Terry 
                         Canyon--

               PAINE is seen to be hit by lightning, and his eyes go 
               startledly to McGann in the gallery.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         "--for the purpose of bringing greater 
                         education, mutual understanding--"

               MCGANN rises in the GALLERY, signals to Paine, and starts to 
               go out.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         "--and the healthful life to the 
                         boys of this great and beautiful 
                         land!"

               As Jeff finishes applause breaks out in the gallery. It is 
               caught up and grows. PAINE is seen hurriedly leaving the 
               chamber, while the applause continues.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Our young Senator will make a good 
                         orator when his voice stops changing.

               In the PRESS GALLERY, Saunders is nudging Diz.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Did you like the first act?

                                     DIZ
                         Yeah. What about the second act?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         That's taking place outside now.

               We hear the gavel rapping for order.

               In the CAPITOL VESTIBULE, Paine and McGann come together 
               quickly. They talk in undertones.

                                     MCGANN
                              (in a controlled lather)
                         Did I hear right? Did he say *Willet 
                         Creek*?

                                     PAINE
                         Let's get away from here.
                              (He starts to pull 
                              McGann along)

                                     MCGANN
                         That's dynamite, Joe!

               The scene dissolves to PAINE'S AUTOMOBILE.

                                     PAINE
                         --amazing coincidence! Of all places 
                         in the world--to choose Willet Creek 
                         for his boys' camp!

                                     MCGANN
                         Joe--I'm getting leery of this guy. 
                         We keep calling him dumb--and he 
                         keeps winding up in our hair! I'm 
                         telling you--when he finds out there's 
                         a dam going up where he wants his 
                         camp, he's gonna start asking 
                         questions six ways from Sunday--

                                     PAINE
                         Be quiet, Chick--I'm trying to think--
                              (Then)
                         This Deficiency Bill is going to be 
                         read in the Senate tomorrow.

                                     MCGANN
                         Tomorrow! Joe--he'll hear the section 
                         on Willet Dam. He can't be there!

                                     PAINE
                         I know that.

                                     MCGANN
                         Listen--tomorrow I take him to see 
                         monuments--if I have to hit him over 
                         the head with a couple!

                                     PAINE
                         That won't work, Chick. This boy's 
                         honest, not stupid.

                                     MCGANN
                         Susan!

                                     PAINE
                         My daughter isn't here to carry out 
                         assignments like that for *anybody*.

                                     MCGANN
                         Well, then--this is too much for 
                         *my* lame brain. I'm calling Jim 
                         Taylor.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim's methods won't do in Washington.

                                     MCGANN
                         Joe--listen--all Susan has to do is 
                         turn those big eyes on him--he'll 
                         fall all over himself--just keep him 
                         out of there *one afternoon*--while 
                         they read that bill--

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE OFFICE BUILDING, in the 
               late afternoon, and JEFFERSON is seen marching along down 
               the corridor, in high spirits--whistling "Dixie." He turns 
               into his OUTER OFFICE, which is full of people. As he strides 
               in, the people leap up and make a dive for him.

                                     PEOPLE
                         Can I see you, Senator--? 
                         I'm from Jackson City-- 
                         Senator, just one minute of your 
                         time-- 
                         I'm from the old home state, Senator--

               Saunders, who has been sitting at her desk, leaps up and 
               comes to the rescue as the people begin to claw and pull 
               Jeff.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Whoa! Here--here--just a minute! 
                         Keep your seats.
                              (Taking Jeff's arm)
                         This way, Senator--

               She leads the dazed Jeff into his PRIVATE OFFICE.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (entering with Saunders)
                         What do they--? Who are all those--?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         One of the plagues on members of 
                         Congress--office-seekers, cranks, 
                         people with pet bills. Get my son 
                         into West Point--or *outta* West 
                         Point. I've got a scheme to put people 
                         to work. How do I get rid of 
                         cockroaches? Some woman's composed a 
                         hymn to replace the Star Spangled 
                         Banner. Want to hear it?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (laughing)
                         No--not today! Boy, I feel like a 
                         house afire! Saunders--how did I do?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Great.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I--I don't know how I got it out. My 
                         heart was right up here all the time--
                              (Then--excitedly)
                         I wonder what Senator Paine thought 
                         of it?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Must have been tickled pink.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Gee--I hope so. What's all this?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Contributions from boys who read 
                         about your camp.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Already? All these letters?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Oh, those are only local. Wait'll 
                         they start pouring in from all over 
                         the country.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Do you mean all--look--look we'd 
                         better open them up--see what they 
                         say here--look at the money--what 
                         does it say--"Dear Senator Smith, I 
                         would like to come to your boy's 
                         camp and I shine shoes at the station 
                         and here's nine cents." Oh, isn't 
                         that wonderful. Look and he signs 
                         it. "Yours truly, Stinky Moore." 
                         Isn't that marvelous?
                              (Breaking off--looking 
                              in desk drawer)
                         Say--have I got some paper here?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Second drawer.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Good! I'm going to be pretty busy 
                         tonight--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Not another bill?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         No! Letters. I've got to write to 
                         the Rangers and Ma--and--I'm bustin' 
                         with news! Why, I've introduced a 
                         bill! Me--Jeff Smith. I got up and 
                         talked in the Senate!
                              (He sits down excitedly 
                              at his desk)

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Do you want to dictate them?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The letters? Gosh--no. I couldn't 
                         talk letters. I've gotta scratch 'em 
                         out. And say--I'm going to tell Ma 
                         all about you. If I tell it right--
                         the first thing you know you're going 
                         to get the best jar of preserves you 
                         ever tasted.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (starting for the 
                              door)
                         Thanks a lot.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh--*Saunders*!

               He comes leaping around from behind the desk--grabbing her 
               hand.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I--I--gee whiz--I didn't thank you!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Don't mention it--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I mean it. I--without you, I 
                         could't've--

               The phone rings. Saunders takes a step to the desk to get 
               the phone. Jefferson goes back behind his desk.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Hello.
                              (Rather startled)
                         Who? Who?

               In the PAINE LIVING ROOM:

                                     SUSAN
                              (on the phone)
                         Susan Paine.

               In JEFFERSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE, Jeff sits at his desk, prepared 
               to write--indifferent to Saunder's conversation. Saunders 
               casts a quick look at Jeff.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (into phone)
                         How do you do?... Yes, go ahead.

               In the PAINE LIVING ROOM:

                                     SUSAN
                         I'm sorry to bother you, Saunders--
                         but you've got to help me. I'm elected 
                         to snatch Mr. Jefferson Smith from 
                         the Senate tomorrow--

               In JEFFERSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE, while Jeff is still busy over 
               his papers:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You're--what?

               In the PAINE LIVING ROOM:

                                     SUSAN
                         There's trouble brewing some place 
                         and I'm to turn on my glamour for 
                         him. I've got to take him out. You 
                         sympathize, don't you, Saunders?

               In JEFFERSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE:

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (with a glance at the 
                              occupied Jeff)
                         Awkward, isn't it?

               In the PAINE LIVING ROOM:

                                     SUSAN
                         Here's what you've got to do for me. 
                         Take him out and buy him a suit of 
                         clothes that fits--and a hat. A 
                         manicure and haircut wouldn't do any 
                         harm--and if you can get in a little 
                         practice with a fork and a teacup--. 
                         As one woman to another, Saunders--
                         that is, I hate to ask you to do it, 
                         but--

               In JEFFERSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE:

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (into the phone)
                         But as one woman to another, of 
                         course.

               In the PAINE LIVING ROOM:

                                     SUSAN
                         Thanks, Saunders. And now--is--uh--
                         young Lochinvar around?

               In JEFFERSON'S PRIVATE OFFICE:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes--right here. Just a second--
                              (Extending phone to 
                              Jeff)
                         Miss Paine.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (looking up as if he 
                              had been kicked)
                         *Who*! Miss--! Is that--? Why didn't 
                         you--? Holy smoke;
                              (Grabbing the phone--
                              breathlessly)
                         H-hello... Yes, Miss Paine... How--
                         how are you, Miss Paine...? What?... 
                         Escort *you* Gee--I mean--*sure*--
                         *yes*! I'd be--. Reception for a 
                         *princess*! Gosh!... Thanks, Miss 
                         Paine. Yes. I--I'll be there! Goodbye, 
                         Miss Paine.
                              (Hanging up, and 
                              getting up excitedly)
                         Did you hear that?--Escort Susan 
                         Paine--reception for a princess! 
                         Imagine her calling me--asking *me*--
                         !

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Get your hat, Senator. We've got a 
                         lot to do between now and tomorrow--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Wow!

               As he makes a dive for his hat, the scene dissolves to 
               glimpses of the shopping tour of Jefferson Smith:

               He has the Prince Albert coat of a new suit on--standing 
               before a mirror--the sleeves too short--looking *really* 
               like a scarecrow--and being frightened of his own image in 
               the mirror. Saunders is standing by, supervising.

               He is trying to walk in a pair of pointed black shoes. His 
               feet hurt terribly.

               He is trying on hats. We catch one that sits on his head 
               like a peanut. He looks to Saunders, who shakes her head.

               In a barber's chair--his hair being cut--his nails are being 
               manicured. He stares unbelievingly down at the manicurist's 
               work.

               Jeff, in his rooms, is getting all tricked out in his new 
               clothes. Saunders ties his tie and puts a flower in his 
               buttonhole.

               Finally the scene dissolves into the PAINE LIMOUSINE, and we 
               see, at last, the full result of the dressing of Jefferson 
               Smith--togged out from top to toe, and very uncomfortable. 
               Susan snatches glances at the effect, out of the corner of 
               her eyes.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (with a struggle)
                         I--I'm awfully glad to be--that is, 
                         it was nice of you to--
                              (Giving up, he makes 
                              an attempt at 
                              conversation)
                         Uh--how's your father?

                                     SUSAN
                         Splendid.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Uh--that's good. And--uh--you?

                                     SUSAN
                         I'm splendid, too.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         That's--that's splendid.

                                     SUSAN
                         And how's your bill, Senator?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh, the bill. Oh--splendid--I mean--
                              (With a disarming 
                              smile)
                         I--I just can't seem to talk in this 
                         suit.
                              (Her eyebrows lift)
                         I'll tell you a secret. It's brand 
                         new.

                                     SUSAN
                         Well! You don't say!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (intimately--boyishly)
                         It's just as well to tell you--because 
                         if we're going to get off on the 
                         right foot--I mean--in case I act 
                         sort of strange--it's the suit.

                                     SUSAN
                              (at a loss)
                         Well--I--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (laughing)
                         Funnier things have happened. Ma 
                         says when Pa was courting her, he 
                         acted strange for months. Didn't 
                         make sense--or anything. And one 
                         day, on a hunch, Ma said: "Clayton, 
                         so help me, you talk like a man whose 
                         collar is too tight to bear." "Not 
                         the collar, Mary," he said, "my 
                         shoes." "Well, for land's sake," Ma 
                         said, "Take the pesky things off!" 
                         Which Pa did, an' they were engaged 
                         within a week.

                                     SUSAN
                         You're not going to take your *suit* 
                         off!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (alarmed)
                         No! No! Gosh. See, there you are! 
                         I'm not making sense!

               The scene dissolves to the LIVING ROOM OF DIZ'S APARTMENT, 
               at dinner time. Diz is mixing a drink. Saunders, her hat on 
               as though she hasn't been there long, is restless.

                                     DIZ
                         Well--I stuck my foot in it again at 
                         the President's press conference 
                         today--
                              (Casually)
                         How come so early? Get the day off?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         They decoyed the little General off 
                         to a tea party to keep him out of 
                         the Senate.

                                     DIZ
                         Well, well--
                              (Then--picking up)
                         Yeah--I got smart and thought I'd 
                         slip one over on the old man in the 
                         press meeting. I said, "Mr. President, 
                         about the monopoly investigation--" 
                         And he jumps right in and says, "Diz, 
                         if you were sitting in my chair, 
                         would you answer the question you're 
                         about to ask?" He had me.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (paying no attention)
                         I don't mind *who* gets licked in a 
                         *fair* fight, Diz. It's these clouts 
                         below the belt I can't take. Sicking 
                         that horrible dame on him--when he's 
                         goofy about her--

                                     DIZ
                         What dame?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Paine.

                                     DIZ
                         Oh--yeah--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         He isn't going to hurt enough as it 
                         is. *She* has to twist a knife in 
                         him, too--the regal jackass! "I'll 
                         turn my glamour on him," she says--

                                     DIZ
                         Forget it, kid. What's it *to* you?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Nothing. I'm just saying--I might be 
                         able to lie, cheat, steal--and I'd 
                         still tear into a guy I saw kicking 
                         a dog. Not that *he* is, by a long 
                         shot--

                                     DIZ
                         Okay. So what? Stop worrying. I've 
                         told you--the dopes are gonna inherit 
                         the earth anyway--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I've wondered, Diz--maybe this Don 
                         Quixote's got the jump on all of us. 
                         I've wondered--maybe it's a curse to 
                         go through life wised up like you 
                         and me--

                                     DIZ
                         Now, look, kid--if we're gonna wonder, 
                         let's go down and do it over a hunk 
                         of steak.
                              (Handing her a drink)
                         Come on, snap out of it. Diz Moore--
                         that rarest of companions--is here 
                         at your side.
                              (Lifting his glass)
                         To genteel crime, kid.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (lifting hers)
                         And to Don Quixote!

               The scene dissolves to a RESTAURANT at night, with SAUNDERS 
               AND DIZ at a corner table--drinks in front of them--both 
               feeling pretty high and loose-tongued. Saunders is alternating 
               lightness with grimness. (Music from someplace off). Diz is 
               finishing a story.

                                     DIZ
                         --and the guy sees a drunk, lookin' 
                         around under the street lamp, see--
                         and he says--whatsa matter?--lose 
                         somethin'? Yeah--my cigarette case--
                         dropped it in the next block.
                              (Pointing way over)
                         Next block!--the guy says to the 
                         drunk--whaddaya lookin' for it here 
                         for?... 'Cause there's more light 
                         here, the drunk says--

               They laugh.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Why do I always laugh at that?

                                     DIZ
                         "There's more light here," he says--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Drunks are funny--

                                     DIZ
                         Yeah. Funny--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (reflectively--sober 
                              suddenly)
                         Yeah.

                                     DIZ
                         Yeah. Some of my best friends are 
                         funny.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Every time I think of it, I get a 
                         laugh, Diz.

                                     DIZ
                         My friends?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Old Don Quixote--man of the people 
                         Smith--

                                     DIZ
                              (calling)
                         Waiter!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         --followin' Miss Susan Fass-Pass 
                         around--his little heart poundin' 
                         away--the sound of angels' wings in 
                         his ears.

               The waiter comes over.

                                     DIZ
                         Now, you've gone and let Don Quixote 
                         in here again. I told you to keep 
                         him out!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Shut up, Diz.

                                     DIZ
                              (to waiter)
                         Mind, now! Keep Don Quixote out of 
                         here!

               The waiter backs away--shaking his head.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         And I got him all dressed up, too--
                         to go way up in a balloon--so they 
                         can drop him a long way--make sure 
                         they break his heart. Why, not all 
                         the Boy Rangers in the world, working 
                         night shifts, 'll be able to put 
                         Humpty-Dumpty together again--

                                     DIZ
                         Now--how'd Humpty-Dumpty get in here?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Do you know how I felt, Diz?

                                     DIZ
                         No. How'd you feel? Quick.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Like a mother sending her kid off to 
                         school for the first time--watchin' 
                         the little fella toddling off--in 
                         his best bib and tucker--and you 
                         sink in the middle--hoping he can 
                         stand up to the other kids--won't 
                         get his feeling hurt--and--if you 
                         could only spare him the knocks he's 
                         gotta take--
                              (Catching herself)
                         Say--who started this?

                                     DIZ
                         *I'm* just waiting for a street car--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well--cut it out. See? Who *cares* 
                         anyway?

                                     DIZ
                         I apologize.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         *All right*, then. After all, what's 
                         it to me? So they *drop* him out of 
                         a balloon. All I care is--I don't 
                         want to be around. See? Squeamish. 
                         See? That's what I am. No, sir. I 
                         don't have to take it. Won't be a 
                         party to no murder. I'm gonna quit. 
                         I'm through.

                                     DIZ
                         Again? Good idea.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Diz--

                                     DIZ
                         Yeah.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         How about getting married?

                                     DIZ
                              (same tone)
                         Good idea. When?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Any time.

                                     DIZ
                         Tonight?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Okay. You don't mind?

                                     DIZ
                         I'll cherish ya.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You--you've been a good egg, Diz. 
                         Maybe we could clear out of this 
                         town--get to feel like *people*--get 
                         the habit of lifting up our eyes--
                         live like we just got out of a tunnel.

                                     DIZ
                              (startled)
                         Tunnel?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You've never seen prairie grass with 
                         the wind leaning on it, have you, 
                         Diz?

                                     DIZ
                         Is the wind tired out there?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Or angry little mountain streams--
                         and cattle moving against the sun. 
                         You haven't seen any of that, have 
                         you, Diz?

                                     DIZ
                         Have *you*?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No.

                                     DIZ
                         Do we *have* to?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (flinging the mood 
                              off)
                         No! I can't think of anything more 
                         sappy!)

                                     DIZ
                         Well, let's get going.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Where?

                                     DIZ
                         We're gonna get married.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (getting her purse 
                              and hat together)
                         Yeah--that's right. Diz--

                                     DIZ
                         What?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I case you don't know--I want to 
                         give ya a chance to back out if you 
                         don't like it--

                                     DIZ
                         What?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         My first name's--Clarissa.

                                     DIZ
                         Yeah, I know. That's okay.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Don't say "okay," Diz. Say you think 
                         it's beautiful.

                                     DIZ
                         Okay--I mean--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You don't know a name off-hand you 
                         like better, do you, Diz?

                                     DIZ
                              (thinking)
                         No--not offhand--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Nothing like--uh--Susan--or anything 
                         like that, huh?

                                     DIZ
                         Susan? Nah!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (breaking into Diz 
                              violently)
                         I won't take it! See? I won't be 
                         party to murder. See? Steering a 
                         poor dope up blind alleys for that 
                         grafting Taylor mob is low enough. 
                         But helping that dame cut him up in 
                         little pieces besides--nobody's gonna 
                         make me do that. No, sir.

                                     DIZ
                         You said it!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I'm getting out of there. Right now, 
                         Diz. Right now. Bonus or no bonus. 
                         I'm gonna clear outa that office--
                         everything I own--my extra hat--
                         everything--

               She starts to scramble out from behind the table. Diz is 
               startled by her sudden, furious movements.

                                     DIZ
                         Hey! We're gettin' married--!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (without pausing)
                         Right now--everything I own--!

               She is on her way. Diz, with a great effort, scrambles out 
               from behind the table after her.

               The scene dissolves to JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE, where JEFFERSON, 
               his collar undone, is writing with great eagerness, his eyes 
               alight. Suddenly a desk drawer slams off scene. He looks up.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (calling)
                         Saunders?

               No reply. Another desk drawer slams.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Saunders!

                                     SAUNDERS' VOICE
                         Whadaya want?

               Jeff, puzzled at the tone of her voice, rises. He starts 
               slowly around from his desk.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Saunders--I looked for you--

               She appears in the doorway, pugnaciously.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yeah? What for?

               She heads for the coat-rack to get her extra hat.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I know. Don't tell me. It was a 
                         wonderful party. Your suit went over 
                         big. And she looked beautiful, and 
                         she gave her hand when you left her--
                         and said--"Thank you, Mr. Smith." 
                         Oh, but it was the way she *said* 
                         it. You like to fell through the 
                         floor--Horseradish!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (fairly speechless 
                              under this violent 
                              attack)
                         Saunders--!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         And you're writing Ma all about it. 
                         And your pigeons will carry the 
                         message of love. And the first thing 
                         you know--Susan Paine'll get the 
                         best jar of preserves she ever tasted!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Are you drunk?

               She returns to the OUTER OFFICE--Jeff following.

               There Diz is collapsed in a chair, and Saunders is collecting 
               her things.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Certainly. You didn't think I was a 
                         lady, did you? You don't think a 
                         *lady* would be working for this 
                         outfit. Even *I* can't take it 
                         anymore. I quit. Can't take a lot of 
                         things. *You*. I can't watch a simple 
                         guy like you--
                              (Breaking off--in a 
                              burst)
                         Why don't you go back home? Take my 
                         advice. Go on back to your prairies--
                         roust your rangers around--tell your 
                         little streams about your camp and 
                         the land of the free! This isn't any 
                         place for you. You're half-way decent. 
                         You don't belong here. Go home. That's 
                         all I'll tell you. That's all. I owe 
                         my conscience that much. I owe it a 
                         lot more, but--
                              (Suddenly--indicating 
                              Diz)
                         Meet the man I'm going to marry!

               DIZ is seen forcing a smile and feeble wave at Jeff.

                                     DIZ
                         Tha's me.

               Saunders turns viciously on Jeff, who is stunned and silent.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well--why don't you say something--
                         what are you standing there for--?
                              (Then--on a wild 
                              impulse)
                         Wait a minute!

               She tears for the files--dives into one section of them.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Why don't I get out of this place 
                         clean?
                              (Lifting a printed 
                              bill out)
                         Want to be a Senator, huh? Gonna 
                         build a camp on Willet Creek! See 
                         this? Appropriations Bill. A little 
                         section--number forty. A *dam's* 
                         going up where you think you're gonna 
                         have a camp. Ever hear of it? No. 
                         They read all about it in the Senate 
                         today--but you weren't supposed to 
                         hear it. That's why that ritzy dame 
                         took you in tow. That's why they 
                         sent you here in the first place--
                         because you wouldn't know a dam from 
                         a bathtub!
                              (Flinging it on a 
                              desk)
                         Go ahead--*try* to build your camp--
                         *try* to mess up Mr. Taylor's little 
                         graft! Go ahead--be a Senator! But 
                         if you *can't* be--and you can't in 
                         nine million years--go on home--don't 
                         hang around here making people feel 
                         sorry for you! Come on, Diz.

               She grabs Diz by the hand and pulls him to the door, while 
               Jeff stares blankly at the bill on the desk.

               In the CORRIDOR, DIZ and SAUNDERS come through. She stops, 
               looking ahead dazedly.

                                     DIZ
                         Well--let's dig up the preacher, 
                         kid.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (in a suddenly sobered 
                              trance)
                         Huh?

                                     DIZ
                         You know, we're getting married.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (suddenly cracking 
                              up, sobbing)
                         Take me home, Diz.

               The scene dissolves to PAINE'S LIVING ROOM at night. Jeff is 
               on his feet, in the midst of a dramatic delivery. Paine is 
               trying to sit calmly and judicially. McGann, tipped back in 
               a chair, is whittling his nails, trying to seem disinterested.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (emphatically)
                         --I may not know much about a lot of 
                         things, sir--but I know that Willet 
                         Creek country like a book--and--and 
                         I tell you, Senator Paine--there's 
                         something *wrong* about this dam--
                         why, there isn't a foot of water in 
                         that creek--it's dry four months out 
                         of the--

                         Jeff--listen--this was all taken up 
                         in the State Legislature and approved--
                         they're going to divert waters from 
                         up above--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         But--there are a hundred other places 
                         in the state that *need* the water. 
                         Besides--I talked to Kenneth Allen, 
                         who owns some of that land--and he 
                         didn't say anything about a dam. No--
                         I'm sure, sir--there's something 
                         wrong--and I--I won't vote on this 
                         thing until I get a lot of questions 
                         answered--

                                     PAINE
                              (strongly)
                         Jeff! You're trying to understand in 
                         a moment everything about a project 
                         that took two years to set up--the 
                         reasons--the benefits--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes--the *benefits*! What's a man 
                         called Taylor got to do with this?

               McGann's tipped-back chair comes forward with a thud and he 
               gets up.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         He's a newspaper publisher I know--
                         and--

                         What makes you think he's got 
                         *anything* to do with it?

                         Saunders said--this whole thing was 
                         *his* idea to get graft--!

                                     PAINE
                              (forcefully)
                         One minute, Jeff!

               McGann starts quickly in the direction of the foyer.

                                     PAINE
                         You're accusing *me* of helping to 
                         frame a bill for the benefit of *one* 
                         individual--

               McGann enters a TELEPHONE CLOSET in the foyer and picks up 
               the phone.

                                     PAINE'S VOICE
                         --of helping to put through a scheme 
                         for *graft*!

               McGann kicks the door closed.

               The scene dissolves to the GOVERNOR'S LIBRARY at night. Hubert 
               is in his dressing gown and nightshirt--fearful. Taylor paces 
               furiously. Kenneth Allen, middle-aged, sits by quietly.

                         Will you please tell me *exactly* 
                         what he's done?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Yes! He's about to blow the whole 
                         machine to smithereens--and *you 
                         with it*, Mr. Governor!

                                     HUBERT
                         Me! Jim--how--?

                                     TAYLOR
                         You couldn't understand! Listen, Ten 
                         Thumbs, I'll be on my way to 
                         Washington in half an hour. Whatever 
                         happens, I'm all ready for this Ranger 
                         of yours. Never mind how. You'll get 
                         your instructions from Ken Allen 
                         here. It isn't anything you have to 
                         do. I wouldn't trust you to lick a 
                         stamp. Allen'll do it himself. You 
                         just use your *high office* to help 
                         him get it done. Understand?

                                     HUBERT
                         Y-yes, Jim.

                                     TAYLOR
                         I doubt it! Come on, Ken.

               Taylor starts for the door--Allen following.

                                     HUBERT
                         Jim--wait--will you please tell me--
                         ?

               Taylor and Allen have slammed out.

                                     HUBERT
                              (protesting frantically--
                              to himself)
                         Blow *me* to smithereens! My record 
                         is *clean*!

               The scene dissolves to TAYLOR'S HOTEL SUITE in Washington, 
               with Taylor seen at his breakfast--calm, quiet. Around him 
               are Paine, McGann and three men--Congressmen Radner, Schultz 
               and Diggs.

                                     PAINE
                              (nervously)
                         --I've used every argument in the 
                         world to try to turn him off. He 
                         just keeps coming back to the dam--
                         and what he knows--

                                     MCGANN
                         Saunders! I'd like to tie her in a 
                         sack and drop her from the Brooklyn 
                         Bridge--

                                     PAINE
                              (waving at the three 
                              men)
                         --now he wants to talk to the 
                         Congressmen from the Willet Creek 
                         districts--he's run their names down--

               There is a knock on the door.

                                     TAYLOR
                         That's him. Let him in.

                                     PAINE
                              (suddenly--alarmed)
                         Wait a minute--Jim--you didn't ask 
                         *Smith* over here!

                                     TAYLOR
                         What do you think?

                                     PAINE
                         Jim, you can't come here and pull 
                         that steamroller stuff. Your methods 
                         won't do here. This boy is a Senator, 
                         however it happened, he's a Senator. 
                         This is Washington.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Steamroller stuff, Joe? My methods 
                         don't go in Washington? They've done 
                         pretty well by now, haven't they?

                                     PAINE
                         Oh, Jim, that's beside the point. 
                         This boy's different. He's honest 
                         and beside he thinks the world of 
                         me. We can't do this to him.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Well, what do you want me to do? 
                         Stand around like you chump and let 
                         that drooling infant wrap that Willet 
                         Creek Dam appropriation around my 
                         neck. Either he falls in line with 
                         us and behaves himself or I'll break 
                         him so wide open they'll never be 
                         able to find the pieces.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim, I won't stand for it.

                                     TAYLOR
                         You won't stand for it?

                                     PAINE
                         I don't want any part of crucifying 
                         this boy.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Oh, I see. Out steamroller methods 
                         are getting too hard to your sensitive 
                         soul, is that it, Joe? The Silver 
                         Knight is getting to big for us. My 
                         methods have been all right for the 
                         past twenty years, Joe, since I picked 
                         you out of a fly-specked hole in the 
                         wall and blew you up to look like a 
                         Senator, and now you can't stand it. 
                         Well, maybe you won't have to stand 
                         it, Joe. Maybe we can fix it so you 
                         and your Boy Ranger can go home 
                         together.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim, you don't have to--

                                     TAYLOR
                         Oh, it's all right--it's all right. 
                         It seems a shame, though, to part 
                         company like this after all these 
                         years, especially now with a national 
                         convention coming up. Joe, I've put 
                         everything I have behind you. And so 
                         did all of our friends, but I guess 
                         we'll survive. We'll just have to 
                         find somebody else that's got a little 
                         more sense, that's all. In the 
                         meantime, you explain to Mr. Smith 
                         about Willet Dam. It's your bill--
                         it's your reputation, and if he can't 
                         find enough facts to break you with, 
                         you just send him to me and I'll 
                         give him a couple of good ones. I'm 
                         taking the next plane home.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim, it's just that I like the kid--
                         I don't want to see you get too rough 
                         on him.

                                     TAYLOR
                         I'm glad to see you come to your 
                         senses. You had me scared there for 
                         a minute, thought.
                              (To McGann)
                         Let him in.

               McGann opens the door, and Jeff stands in the doorway.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Come in.

               Jeff enters, looking around at the faces he has never seen 
               before.

                                     PAINE
                         Jeff--this is Mr. Taylor.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (taking his hand)
                         Glad to know you, Senator. Meet the 
                         boys--

                                     PAINE
                              (quickly)
                         Congressmen, Radner, Schultz, Diggs--

                                     VOICES OF CONGRESSMEN
                         How are you, Senator? 
                         Glad to know you. 
                         How do you do?

                                     TAYLOR
                         I happened to be passing through, 
                         Senator. I wanted to meet you. Thanks 
                         for coming. Sit down.

               Jeff hesitates, looks at the men, his eyes resting on Paine 
               a moment. More and more puzzled, he takes a chair just a 
               step away.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Well. I hear you've been right on 
                         your toes since you got here. Pitching 
                         right in. Lots of people took you 
                         for dumb--but they're wrong. You're 
                         smart. In fact, *I* think you're 
                         smart enough to understand a situation 
                         when it's explained to you--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Like what, Mr. Taylor?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Well now--just to take an example--
                         putting up a dam--on Willet Creek. 
                         As I look at it--that dam's going to 
                         do the people of our state a lot of 
                         good--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, so I was told, Mr. Taylor, but--

                                     TAYLOR
                              (interrupting)
                         But you have some objections here 
                         and there. And maybe right, for all 
                         I know. But the point is--there's no 
                         sense stopping the whole works now--
                         specially after some men have worked 
                         hard for a long time to put this 
                         through--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         What is your interest in this, Mr. 
                         Taylor?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Mine? Why--naturally--whatever 
                         benefits the state is mighty important 
                         to me--owning a lot of its industry--
                         newspapers and other odds and ends. 
                         And if I thought you had the welfare 
                         of the state at heart, like myself--
                         for instance, if you were to turn 
                         around and help a project like this 
                         along instead of standing in the way--
                         why, I'd say you were a man to watch. 
                         For a fellow your age, you'd be in a 
                         spot to make a great start in life. 
                         If you liked business--you could 
                         pick any job in the state and go 
                         right to the top. Or politics. If 
                         you like being a Senator. No reason 
                         why you couldn't come back to that 
                         Senate for the rest of your life.

                                     PAINE
                         Jim!

                                     TAYLOR
                              (sharply)
                         Just a minute, Joe!

                                     PAINE
                              (fighting)
                         You can't say *that* to--

                                     TAYLOR
                         *I* know what I'm doing! I'll say 
                         what I *want*!

               Paine rushes to the door and is gone. There is silence for 
               an instant. Jeff rises.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Sit down, Smith. I'm not through.

               Jeff remains standing.

                                     TAYLOR
                         As I was saying--the state *needs* 
                         men like you--*smart* men.
                              (Indicating the boys)
                         Now, these boys are. And they've 
                         been doing all right. They don't 
                         worry about being re-elected--or 
                         anything else. They take my advice--
                         and they'll go a lot farther yet. 
                         So, you see, you've got a pretty 
                         important question to settle for 
                         yourself, Smith. But you're smart. 
                         You can decide that right now, can't 
                         you?

               Jeff looks from Taylor to the other boys.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (after a pause)
                         Can't you?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (quietly)
                         You mean--you tell these men--and 
                         Senator Paine what to do?

                                     TAYLOR
                         Yes! I've told Senator Paine for 
                         twenty years--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You're a liar!

               Jeff turns and starts for the door. Taylor rushes after him.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Smith!
                              (Stopping him at the 
                              door)
                         You heard what I said. And I've *got* 
                         to have your answer--*now*!
                              (As Jeff starts to go)
                         Listen. To put it another way--if 
                         you've got any fool notion of bucking 
                         this thing--if you open your mouth 
                         when that bill is read in the Senate 
                         tomorrow--if you so much as lift a 
                         finger to stop it--you're through--
                         like no man *ever* was! I'm all ready 
                         for you. Understand? I give you my 
                         word on that. You're finished!

               Jeff grabs violently for the door and barges out.

                                     TAYLOR
                         I give you my word!

               The scene dissolves to PAINE'S PRIVATE SENATE OFFICE, as 
               Jeff enters, closing the door behind him. Paine, standing 
               near his desk--strained and miserable--cannot meet Jeff's 
               accusing, damning gaze.

                                     PAINE
                              (faltering)
                         Jeff--I want to talk to you--sit 
                         down--

               Jeff remains standing--his eyes fixed on Paine.

                                     PAINE
                         Listen, Jeff--you--you don't 
                         understand these things--you mustn't 
                         condemn me for my part in this without--
                         you've had no experience--you see 
                         things as black or white--and a man 
                         as angel or devil. That's the young 
                         idealist in you. And that isn't how 
                         the world runs, Jeff--certainly not 
                         Government and politics. It's a 
                         question of give and take--you have 
                         to play the rules--compromise--you 
                         have to leave your ideals outside 
                         the door, with your rubbers. I feel 
                         I'm the right man for the Senate. 
                         And there are certain powers--
                         influence. To stay there, I must 
                         respect them. And now and then--for 
                         the sake of that power--a dam has to 
                         be built--and one must shut his eyes. 
                         It's--it's a small compromise. The 
                         *best* men have had to make them. Do 
                         you understand?
                              (Desperately and with 
                              greater emotion as 
                              Jeff is silent)
                         I know how you feel, Jeff. Thirty 
                         years ago--I had those ideals, too. 
                         I was *you*. I had to make the 
                         decision you were asked to make today.
                              (Breaking out)
                         And I compromised--yes! So that all 
                         these years I could stay in that 
                         Senate--and serve the people in a 
                         thousand honest ways! You've got to 
                         face facts, Jeff. I've served our 
                         State well, haven't I? We have the 
                         lowest unemployment and the highest 
                         Federal grants. But, well, I've had 
                         to compromise, had to play ball. You 
                         can't count on people voting, half 
                         the time they don't vote, anyway. 
                         That's how states and empires have 
                         been built since time began. Don't 
                         you understand? Well, Jeff, you can 
                         take my word for it, that's how things 
                         are. Now I've told you all this 
                         because--well, I've grown very fond 
                         of you--about like a son--in fact, 
                         and I don't want to see you get hurt. 
                         Now, when that Deficiency Bill comes 
                         up in the Senate tomorrow you stay 
                         away from it. Don't say a word. Great 
                         powers are behind it, and they'll 
                         destroy you before you can even get 
                         started. For your own sake, Jeff, 
                         and for the sake of my friendship 
                         with your father, please, don't say 
                         a word.

               Jeff goes out quickly--as Paine stops dead, staring after 
               him.

               The scene dissolves to the VISITOR'S ROOM adjacent to the 
               Senate Chamber, with TAYLOR and PAINE huddled together, 
               talking in low tones and rapidly--people occasionally passing 
               in the background.

                                     TAYLOR
                         It's in your lap, Joe. Keep an eye 
                         on him. If he gets to his feet and 
                         says anything--

                                     PAINE
                         It's crucifying him--!

                                     TAYLOR
                         Anything *better* to offer?

                                     PAINE
                         Maybe he won't get up.

                                     TAYLOR
                         But--if he *does*, Joe--

               The bell sounds--Paine walks away quickly.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (calling after in low 
                              voice--cautioning)
                         Joe! If he *does*--!

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE CHAMBER, which first reveals 
               the PRESIDENT of the Senate speaking.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         --during the consideration of the 
                         Deficiency Bill, there is a unanimous 
                         consent agreement--

               JEFFERSON is seen keeping his head up, his expression 
               revealing nothing about what he intends to do.

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         --that no Senator shall speak more 
                         than once, or longer than five minutes--

               PAINE is seen looking over at Jefferson.

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         --on any section of the bill. The 
                         clerk will begin the reading.

               Now the CLERK rises with a copy of the bill in his hands.

                                     CLERK
                              (reading)
                         "A bill providing for deficiency 
                         appropriations for the fiscal year. 
                         Section One. For emergency relief--"

               In the VISITOR'S GALLERY, TAYLOR AND MCGANN are sitting 
               tensely, looking down on the Senate floor.

                                     CLERK'S VOICE
                         "--to create and erect public 
                         improvements on rivers, harbors and 
                         roadways in the states of--"

               In the SENATE, the CLERK in now half-way through the bill, 
               held plainly in his hands.

                                     CLERK
                              (reading)
                         "Section Forty: An appropriation for 
                         diverting and impounding the 
                         headwaters of Willet Creek--"

               JEFFERSON is seen alert and anxious and determined.

                                     CLERK'S VOICE
                         "--in the natural basin of Terry 
                         Canyon. Five million dollars--"

               Jeff leaps up. His hands are clenched. His face is white.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Mr. President!

               TAYLOR AND MCGANN, in the Visitor's Gallery, come forward in 
               their seats.

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         Does the Senator desire to be heard 
                         on Section Forty?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (on his feet now)
                         I do, sir.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         The Senator understands he is limited 
                         to five minutes?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (tense and pale)
                         Yes, sir--

               In the VISITOR'S GALLERY, Taylor's eyes are darting fire in 
               the direction of Paine.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (viciously--under his 
                              breath)
                         Joe!

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         You may proceed.

               In the CHAMBER, Paine is seen holding the corners of his 
               desk tensely.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         Mr. President--this section of the 
                         bill--this dam on Willet Creek is 
                         nothing but a--

                                     PAINE
                         Mr. President!

               Paine is on his feet. Jeff, puzzled, looks toward Paine and 
               stops.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (to Jeff)
                         Does Senator Smith yield to his 
                         colleague Senator Paine?

               JEFFERSON, his eyes wonderingly on Paine, doesn't know what 
               to do for an instant.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (hesitantly)
                         Y-yes.

                                     PAINE
                              (with difficulty--
                              while Jeff remains 
                              standing)
                         Mr. President--gentlemen--I--I have 
                         risen to a painful duty--to say that, 
                         out of evidence that has come to my 
                         attention, I consider Senator Smith 
                         unworthy to address this body!

               Senators turn around to look at Paine--on such an amazing 
               statement. A hum from the gallery. The gavel pounds.

               JEFFERSON, seen closely, has his head turned to Paine in 
               frank wonderment.

                                     PAINE'S VOICE
                         I--I have hesitated to speak--but, 
                         in all conscience--

               TAYLOR AND MCGANN are now tense but relieved.

                                     PAINE'S VOICE
                         --I must.

               PAINE, seen at close view, is under great strain, looking 
               away from Jeff and toward the chair.

                                     PAINE
                         It is a charge as grave and--and as 
                         infamous--as has ever been made from 
                         the floor against a fellow member--

               In the PRESS GALLERY, the Press Men are leaning forward 
               alertly--mouths open to catch the next word.

                                     PAINE'S VOICE
                         I refer to the bill he has introduced 
                         in this chamber to create a National 
                         Boy's Camp. He named a portion of 
                         land to be dedicated for that purpose--
                              (Hurling his charge 
                              with desperate 
                              strength)
                         and to be bought by contributions 
                         from boys all over America.
                              (Gritting his teeth 
                              to go on)
                         Senators--I have conclusive evidence 
                         to prove that my colleague *owns* 
                         the very land he described in his 
                         bill! He bought it the day following 
                         his appointment to the Senate! And 
                         is holding it--using this body and 
                         his privileged office--to legalize 
                         an outrageous profit for himself--
                         out of the purchase of that land 
                         through the nickels and dimes scraped 
                         together by the boys of this country--
                         !

               A close view reveals JEFFERSON, struck dumb and cold--as an 
               uproar goes up around him. And a close view shows TAYLOR AND 
               MCGANN satisfied, relieved, amid the shouting.

               In the PRESS GALLERY, the reporters pile up the narrow aisle 
               stairs to the press room behind them, as the uproar in the 
               Senate is heard. In the SENATE PRESS ROOM (behind the Press 
               Gallery), the press boys come rushing in and dive for the 
               telegraphic services of the various newspaper men shouting:

               --a near riot! Ranger Smith branded from the floor by--

               --Paine hurls sensational graft charge at--

               --nothing like it in fifty years! Paine charges Smith using 
               office to--

               Senate orders immediate hearings--before committee on 
               Privileges and Elections--! Most terrific accusation in the 
               history of--

               The scene dissolves to the SMITH SITTING ROOM in Jackson 
               City. It is evening and Ma is surrounded by kids--all staring 
               at headlines.

                                     A BOY
                         Jeff--doing anything like that!

                                     ANOTHER
                         They--they're crazy!

               Thereupon, in the HOPPER STUDY at night, Hubert, stricken 
               numb, is being attacked by his children who have papers in 
               their hands.

                                     PETER
                         *Jeff*--take money from *kids*!

                                     JIMMIE
                         It's a *frame*!

                                     OTIS
                         A dirty frame!

                                     HUBERT
                              (calling for help)
                         Emma!

               The scene dissolves to DOORS in the Senate Building on which 
               are printed the words COMMITTEE ON PRIVILEGES AND ELECTIONS; 
               and to the COMMITTEE ROOM, with the Committee in session--a 
               closed hearing. Kenneth Allen is on the stand.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         How long have you known Senator Smith, 
                         Mr. Allen?

                                     ALLEN
                         Oh--a good many years. He used to 
                         use my land up around Willet Creek 
                         every summer for his scout camps. 
                         Seemed like a mighty nice fellow. 
                         And when he can to me with this 
                         proposition--

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         What proposition?

                                     ALLEN
                         Why--a deal for those two hundred 
                         acres. 'Course, at the time, I didn't 
                         know about his appointment to the 
                         Senate--or anything like that--

                                     A SENATOR
                         Did he say what he wanted those two 
                         hundred acres for?

                                     ALLEN
                         No. He wouldn't tell me at the time. 
                         He just made me this proposition. 
                         Said he had a great chance to sell 
                         that land for about five hundred an 
                         acre. If I'd deed it to him for six 
                         months, he'd try to turn it over and 
                         split what he got for it. I had 
                         nothing to lose. I'd be glad to sell 
                         for twenty-five an acre. So we set 
                         it up like this. I deeded him the 
                         land--and *he gave me* a contract 
                         guaranteeing me half what he got if 
                         he made the sale. Sounded kinda fishy 
                         at the time--and when I heard about 
                         his camp bill I knew there was some 
                         dirty business going on and I went 
                         right to Governor Hopper with the 
                         whole story--

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Have you got that contract, Mr. Allen?

                                     ALLEN
                              (going into his pocket)
                         You don't think that land would be 
                         in his name if I didn't have, do 
                         you?

               Now Hubert Hopper is on the stand--perspired and anxious.

                                     HUBERT
                         --frankly, gentlemen--the morning 
                         Mr. Kenneth Allen burst into my office 
                         bringing proof that Jefferson Smith 
                         had bought that land--well, frankly, 
                         I--I was dumbfounded! Jefferson Smith--
                         of all people! *Never* was a chief 
                         executive so--so *betrayed* in his 
                         child like trust in man! To think 
                         that--

                                     CHAIRMAN
                              (interrupting wearily)
                         Pardon me, Governor. We're interested 
                         in certain facts at the moment. What 
                         did you do when Mr. Allen brought 
                         this matter to your attention?

                                     HUBERT
                         I consulted at once with the Head of 
                         the Department of Records--Arthur 
                         Kim.

               Now Arthur Kim is on the witness stand--a smooth, shifty, 
               careful guy.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         Mr. Kim--do you remember recording 
                         this deed?

                                     KIM
                              (with copy of the 
                              deed in his hands)
                         Yes, on the date set forth here, Mr. 
                         Kenneth Allen came before me to record 
                         this deed--setting over these two 
                         hundred acres in the name of Jefferson 
                         Smith--

                                     A SENATOR
                         Let me understand. Mr. Smith did 
                         *not* appear before you?

                                     KIM
                         No, sir. That is not required by our 
                         state law--

               Now Senator Paine is talking to the Committee with apparent 
               difficulty--and reluctance.

                                     PAINE
                         This is a very painful duty for me. 
                         This boy is the son of my very best 
                         friend. I sponsored him in the Senate. 
                         I helped him frame his Bill and the 
                         day he presented it I went over to 
                         congratulate him but I pointed out 
                         that a dam was already going up on 
                         the very site he had chosen for his 
                         camp. There are hundreds of equally 
                         good camp sites nearby and so I 
                         suggested he choose another. He became 
                         furious. He said, "Move the dam." I 
                         was amazed at his violent reaction. 
                         I couldn't understand it, until the 
                         evidence came to me that he owned 
                         those very two hundred acres and, as 
                         you have heard, had carefully made 
                         plans to make an enormous profit out 
                         of the nickels and dimes scraped 
                         together by the boys of this country. 
                         Faced with that and regardless of my 
                         personal feelings for the boy, my 
                         sense of duty told me that his 
                         expulsion from the Senate was the 
                         only possible answer.

               Then Jeff is on the stand--grim, determined, while the 
               chairman holds the deed and contract.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                              (strongly)
                         --what possible explanation can you 
                         offer for this charge being--as you 
                         say--"trumped up" against you!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (firmly)
                         It was done to stop me from talking 
                         about a section of the Appropriations 
                         Bill!

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         It was?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes! This was how I could be put out 
                         of the Senate and out of the way! 
                         They even *promised* me that if I--

                                     A SENATOR
                         Wait a minute. Three days ago this 
                         bill was read in detail before the 
                         body. Why didn't you object then?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I wasn't *in* the Senate that day.

                                     SENATOR
                         Where were you?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         To--to a reception--uh--for a princess--
                         I forget her name--

               After an instant's pause, a quick look passes between the 
               Chairman and the Committee.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         And you say you never signed this 
                         contract with Mr. Allen?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I did not--

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         You've never *seen* this contract.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Never.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         But you did *talk* to Mr. Allen about 
                         that and--?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I--I discussed it with him--yes--
                         because I--you see, I've always had 
                         this camp in mind--but I made no 
                         contract with him!

                                     CHAIRMAN
                              (shoving contract at 
                              Jeff)
                         Then--this is *not* you signature, 
                         Senator?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Looks like it, but--

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         But it *isn't*?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         It couldn't be.

                                     CHAIRMAN
                         You are saying, in effect, that this 
                         is a forgery?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I'm saying I didn't sign it!

               We see JEFFERSON'S HAND writing his name--the eighth signature 
               in a row. Then a MAN on the stand is comparing papers in his 
               hands.

                                     MAN
                         In my professional opinion as an 
                         expert on handwriting, I'd say that 
                         the name of Jefferson Smith on this 
                         contract has been forged--

               Then ANOTHER MAN stands before a large screen, with Jeff's 
               signature blown up on it.

                                     SECOND MAN
                         --after a long study of this signature 
                         it is my professional opinion that 
                         it is definitely in Jefferson Smith's 
                         own handwriting--!

               Then a THIRD MAN is on the stand--with papers spread before 
               him--comparing as he talks.

                                     THIRD MAN
                         It is extremely difficult to tell a 
                         clever forgery from the real thing. 
                         You can always get divided opinions 
                         from experts. But I would stake my 
                         whole twenty-year professional career 
                         on the fact that this is not a 
                         forgery, but is Mr. Smith's own 
                         signature--

               The scene dissolves to TAYLOR'S HOTEL SUITE, at night, Taylor 
               eagerly on the phone--McGann excitedly standing by--Paine 
               standing in the background thoughtfully. Hubert ("Happy") 
               Hopper is also there and looks nervous.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (excitedly)
                         Hello! I said *Sam Hendricks*--the 
                         editor! Can't you hear? This is Jim 
                         Taylor--in Washington. Put him on!
                              (A slight wait)
                         Hendricks! Jim. It's all over. Smith's 
                         hearing's closed--Joe's canvassed 
                         the committee--privately. First thing 
                         tomorrow in the Senate, they'll bring 
                         in a resolution to *expel* him--to 
                         throw him out!

                                     MCGANN
                              (exultantly)
                         A dead goose!

                                     TAYLOR
                              (into the phone)
                         It'll be voted unanimously! Get our 
                         papers ready--smear it all over. And 
                         the second he's out--the Deficiency 
                         Bill passes the Senate--and we're 
                         home! Stick close to the office, 
                         Hendricks--I'll be calling!

               He hangs up. McGann is out of his mind with joy.

                                     MCGANN
                              (to Hopper)
                         Your Ranger's on the garbage pile, 
                         Happy! He's done for!

                                     PAINE
                              (breaking out wildly 
                              at McGann)
                         Shut up! You've *got* the man 
                         pilloried! Do you have to dance around 
                         him like a cannibal--!

                                     TAYLOR
                              (to Hopper)
                         By the skin of your teeth you got 
                         out of this one, Happy--by the skin 
                         of your--!

               Paine is going for the door.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Hey--Joe! Where you going? We've got 
                         to celebrate tonight!

                                     PAINE
                         No--I--I'll take a walk--
                              (He continues out)

               The scene dissolves to SAUNDERS' ROOM at night where Saunders 
               is standing at her window, looking out absently as Diz walks 
               around furiously.

                                     DIZ
                         He's cooked! They'll drum the poor 
                         lug out of that chamber tomorrow as 
                         sure as I'm--! And now they're all 
                         down on him. Yeah--my press pals, 
                         too--he's a bad egg--still water 
                         running deep. Boloney! It's the frame 
                         of all time! When I see a phoney 
                         like this--my journalist blood boils--
                         I wanna *fight*!
                              (Then)
                         Look, kid--rack your brains, will 
                         you? Haven't you got any confidential 
                         stuff on that mob? I'll write my arm 
                         off--I'll blow Taylor and his--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (whirling away from 
                              window)
                         I've told you ten times--if I had 
                         anything they couldn't bat down in a 
                         second, don't you suppose I'd've 
                         been up in that hearing yelling 
                         murder! Sure--he was cooked the night 
                         I sounded off like a fool and spilled 
                         the whole works!

                                     DIZ
                         Then--in the name of kindness to 
                         dumb animals--we can't let him walk 
                         into that Senate tomorrow and take a 
                         terrible punch in a nose! A couple 
                         of us went up there--told him all he 
                         could do was beat it--resign--clear 
                         out. But--he's in a daze--he's been 
                         hit by a ton of bricks. Just says, 
                         "I haven't done anything. Why should 
                         I resign?" He might *listen* to *you*--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Why me?

                                     DIZ
                         Come on--don't pull that. You know 
                         you'd give your right--. What are 
                         you staying away from him for?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         You don't think he'd want *me* within 
                         fifty miles, do you?--after the 
                         exhibition he saw me give! Did you 
                         see his *face*--?

                                     DIZ
                         All I know is--he said to me tonight--
                         "What does your wife think?" My wife. 
                         Thinks we're married--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well, then, that's great! And that's 
                         a great place to leave it! It's no 
                         use *my* barging into this now and--

               A knock on the door stops her.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (calling)
                         Yes!

               The door is opened by Paine. He looks from Saunders to Diz--
               then back to Saunders. Diz glares at Paine with pretty bold 
               contempt.

                                     PAINE
                         I--wanted to see you, Saunders--

               Diz grabs up his hat angrily.

                                     DIZ
                         Go ahead.
                              (Bitterly--as he passes 
                              Paine)
                         Well, we certainly hunted that bad 
                         Ranger down, didn't we? Good work, 
                         *Senator*!

               And Diz slams out. Paine and Saunders stare at each other an 
               instant. Then:

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (with brutal coldness)
                         What do you want, Senator?

                                     PAINE
                         Saunders--it's going to go pretty 
                         bad for Jeff tomorrow. There's only 
                         one thing that can be done for him 
                         now--
                              (Taking a folded paper 
                              from his pocket)
                         I--I've written his resignation. He 
                         resigns under protest--denying all 
                         charges. No one will ever be sure if 
                         he was guilty or not. It leaves him 
                         with at least a shred of honor. The 
                         other way--branded openly in the 
                         Senate--expelled--he'll never live 
                         it down. Rather a simple compromise 
                         than utter ruin. In a year--the whole 
                         thing might be forgotten--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What are you driving at? You want 
                         *me* to get him to sign that?

                                     PAINE
                         Yes--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Why don't you do it yourself?

                                     PAINE
                         He's lost complete faith in me--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Well--me, too!

                                     PAINE
                         But--you love him, don't you, 
                         Saunders?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What are you talking about? What 
                         difference--?

                                     PAINE
                         Do you?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         All right--*yes*! And what does that 
                         make me to him? *Nothing*! I've got 
                         to go about my own business--and 
                         forget it!

                                     PAINE
                         I thought I could, too.

                         *My* business--this fine future! I 
                         have no future I *care* about, if 
                         this boy is broken! I--I can't sleep. 
                         The only important thing in my life 
                         now is to save what I can for him. I 
                         want him to get a start again--I'll 
                         see that he's taken care of as long 
                         as he lives--!
                              (Then)
                         Saunders--whether you ever mean 
                         anything to him or not--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         *Me! Me*! I *still* don't see why I 
                         should--! If you love him so much, 
                         why don't you go to him yourself and--
                         ? Or better still--get up in that 
                         Senate and *fight* for him!

                                     PAINE
                         It's too late now--it's *impossible*!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         So I go right back where I was--
                         carrying compromises--covering up--
                         back to political tricks--this time 
                         for--! No! I was just getting rid of 
                         all that. If I did *anything*, I 
                         ought to go and tell him to stand up 
                         and--. No! I don't want any part of 
                         it! Smith or anything else! I'm all 
                         through. I want to be left alone!

               She turns her back to Paine, and goes to the window. He 
               hesitates a moment--then moves to leave, dropping the folded 
               paper on the table. He goes. Saunders turns and sees the 
               paper. She clamps her jaws and turns away again.

               The scene dissolves to JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE at night. Jeff 
               is behind his desk--only the desk lamp lighted in the room--
               sitting numbly, staring ahead blankly. The phone rings--
               startling him. He picks it up slowly.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Hello... Who?
                              (Hesitating, making a 
                              difficult decision)
                         Yes--all right--I--I'll take it.
                              (Brightening his voice)
                         Hello, Ma.

               The SMITH SITTING ROOM, Ma is on the phone.

                                     MA
                              (with a bright, 
                              cheerful manner)
                         Hello, Jefferson. How are you, son?

               In JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE:

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Just fine, Ma, fine... No--really, 
                         Ma--everything's fine. Uh--how're 
                         all the boys?

               In the SMITH SITTING ROOM:

                                     MA
                              (tears in her eyes)
                         They're wonderful, son. They miss 
                         you a lot--

               In JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE:

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (his chin quivering)
                         Do, huh? Well, gee, that's--that's 
                         great. How's Amos?... Is, huh? Good 
                         for him--

               In the SMITH SITTING ROOM:

                                     MA
                              (getting pretty shaky--
                              swallowing hard)
                         Well--I just got a fool notion to 
                         call, that's all. Oh--Jefferson--you 
                         know, when a man's right--he don't 
                         have to worry none--he'll just 
                         naturally come *out* right. We know 
                         that, don't we, son?

               In JEFF'S PRIVATE OFFICE, we see that Ma has nearly broken 
               Jeff down. He hangs on with all he's got.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Why, sure, Ma, sure.
                              (Quickly--to avoid 
                              crying outright)
                         Well--so long, skinny.

               He hangs up quickly--and rises from his chair. He appears to 
               have been pushed to the breaking point. In terrible torment, 
               he looks out the window. Then, on an impulse, he seizes his 
               hat from off the corner of his desk and starts out.

               The scene dissolves to the LINCOLN MEMORIAL: Jeff is walking 
               up the steps, his eyes lifted up intently to something ahead. 
               THE MEMORIAL stands magnificent and breathtaking--lighted up--
               in the background, as he mounts the steps. Jeff gains the 
               top level and proceeds toward the Lincoln figure, and the 
               stone Lincoln comes into view in the background--dramatically 
               lighted. He approaches to within fifteen feet of the figure 
               and pauses. Now JEFF is scanning the face of Lincoln with a 
               tortured expression. Then, he turns away--as if not being 
               able to face the spirit of the man--and moves quickly to the 
               steps. Then Jeff, nearly blind, stumbling out of the interior 
               of the Memorial, comes to a stop at a column--then breaks 
               down completely, slipping to the steps at the base of the 
               column and burying his face in his hands.

               SAUNDERS is standing near another column close by, her eyes 
               on Jeff, and is swallowing back her tears. When she hears 
               Jeff's sobs, she starts toward him. She comes to him and 
               sits down beside him. It is an instant before he realizes 
               that anyone is there.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (quietly)
                         Hello.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Saunders--

               He turns away, and tries to recover himself. She waits--
               watching him. At last, Jeff can trust himself to talk.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (attempting lightness)
                         Well gee--how--how've you been, 
                         Saunders? I--I haven't seen you in--
                         . I suppose--now that you're married--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I'm not.

               He stares at her.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         No. That night--I--well, *you* know--
                         I was pretty--. No--Diz is a--a sort 
                         of brother, that's all--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (tries to laugh a 
                              little)
                         That's funny. I thought all along--
                              (Then earnestly)
                         Gee--I--I'm glad to see you. I 
                         *thought* of you--I mean--I wanted 
                         to talk to someone and--well--
                              (With toss of head at 
                              statue)
                         --Mr. Lincoln hasn't much to say--
                              (Breaking down--
                              blurting)
                         Saunders--I'm not fit to sit up in 
                         the Senate--haven't you heard?--I 
                         robbed boys of their pennies and 
                         dimes!

               He turns away again, to get control of himself, Saunders 
               watching him.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (after a pause)
                         What are you going to do?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I--I don't know. I--I'm afraid they've 
                         got me licked.

               She takes the resignation from her pocket.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Jeff--Paine asked me to give you 
                         this--your resignation--he wrote it 
                         out--

               He takes it from her incredulously and begins to read.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (as she watches him--
                              quietly)
                         It might save some of the pieces, 
                         Jeff. It would leave a doubt about 
                         the whole thing--about you. Might 
                         blow over, this way.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (avidly--finishes 
                              reading)
                         Yeah. I see. Well--that's about the 
                         only thing to do. Don't you think?

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (non-committally)
                         Well, I guess it's a chance.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yeah. I guess--sometimes--Senator 
                         Paine must be right. Sometimes you--
                         you got to compromise a little--
                              (Breaking off)
                         And if you say so too, Saunders--if 
                         *you* think that's the thing to do--

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (snatching the paper 
                              out of his hand)
                         I *don't* think that's the thing to 
                         do! No! I think what you ought to do 
                         is--*fight*!
                              (She tears up the 
                              paper)

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Wait--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What you *have* to do is fight!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         But--I've done everything I--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I don't care *what* you've done! 
                         Don't quit. Don't grab a measly chance 
                         like this to save a few pieces--other 
                         men could--but not you. As long as 
                         you lived, you'd remember you ran 
                         out and threw this country of yours 
                         to the jackals--!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (burying his head--
                              hopelessly)
                         Oh--Saunders--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Jeff--listen--remember the day you 
                         got here?--what you said about Mr. 
                         Lincoln?--that he was sitting up 
                         there--watching--waiting for someone 
                         to come along? Well--that was *you*. 
                         Someone with a little plain, decent, 
                         uncompromising *rightness*--to root 
                         out the Taylors--yeah, and really 
                         light up that dome for once. This 
                         country could use some of that--so 
                         could the whole drunken, cockeyed 
                         world right now--a *lot* of it! And 
                         when the right man comes along--no 
                         matter *what* the odds--he can't 
                         *ever* quit! A little fellow called 
                         David walked out with only a sling-
                         shot--but he had the *truth* on his 
                         side--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (still hopelessly)
                         Saunders--if there was *any* way--

                                     SAUNDERS
                         We'll *find* one! Only throw 
                         compromise out of the window--stick 
                         to Jeff Smith, the man who first 
                         came to this town--get up and *fight*--
                         and we'll find *some* way. I don't 
                         know where we'll wind up--but the 
                         flag'll be flying--!

               Jeff has been coming to life. Now he suddenly leaps to his 
               feet!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yay!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (getting up, too)
                         Hurray!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Where do we go from here?

                                     SAUNDERS
                         To a hard night's work, son. Come 
                         on!
                              (She seizes his hand 
                              and pulls him down 
                              the steps)

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE CHAMBER, as the PRESIDENT 
               pounds the gavel.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         The Clerk will call the roll.

               The clerk's voice begins to call the names--and the voices 
               of Senators answer. The President looks out to JEFFERSON'S 
               EMPTY DESK. Then PAINE is seen, also looking at Jeff's desk--
               as Paine answers to his own name.

               In the packed VISITOR'S GALLERY, as the roll is heard, an 
               OLD LADY, who is knitting, and an OLD MAN look down.

                                     OLD MAN
                         Nope. Not here. They never show up 
                         to face the music.

                                     OLD LADY
                         Too bad. Might've been a little 
                         excitement.

               TAYLOR and MCGANN are seen smiling down with satisfaction.

                                     MCGANN
                         Well--wasn't in his room last night. 
                         Ten to one he's on a train--headin' 
                         home to Ma.

               In the PRESS GALLERY SWEENEY and FARRELL are looking at Jeff's 
               empty seat.

                                     SWEENEY
                         Well, that's good. Never *could* 
                         stand executions--

               In the SENATE CHAMBER, the CLERK reads a few names, then:

                                     CLERK
                         Jefferson Smith!

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                              (ringing out)
                         Here!

               JEFFERSON enters the Chamber with a brisk step, his head 
               held high. The only thing peculiar about him is the bumpy 
               appearance of his jacket pockets. In his hands are books and 
               papers. Everywhere there are reactions to his appearance. At 
               the ROSTRUM, the Clerk, in amazement, has stopped reading, 
               and watches Jeff's progress to his desk. The SAUNDERS AND 
               DIZ enter the PRESS GALLERY, she carrying a Senate Manual, 
               and JEFF takes his seat in the CHAMBER.

               Then a hum grows over the packed chamber seen in full view.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (banging)
                         The Clerk will proceed with the roll!

               The startled Clerk, proceeds, as JEFF smiles around at the 
               chamber, and then looks up at the Gallery, where Saunders is 
               waving to him--smiling.

               The scene dissolves into the SENATE CHAMBER.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         --proceeding now to the order of 
                         business--

                                     SENATOR'S VOICE
                         Mr. President!

               The Senator, who was chairman of the Committee on Privileges 
               (Dearborn) is on his feet.

                                     DEARBORN
                         In pursuance of the notice I gave 
                         yesterday, I desire to call up the 
                         report of the Committee on Privileges 
                         and Elections on the expulsion of 
                         Jefferson Smith.

               We see JEFFERSON, smiling a shade sickly, looking up at 
               Saunders.

                                     PRESIDENT'S VOICE
                         The Clerk will read the report.

               The Clerk rises. Senator Dearborn remains standing as the 
               report is read, while in the PRESS GALLERY, SAUNDERS is seen 
               indicating "sit tight" to Jeff.

                                     CLERK
                              (reading)
                         The Committee on Privileges and 
                         Elections report: that it appears to 
                         the satisfaction of the Committee, 
                         after hearing a number of witnesses, 
                         that justice to the Senate requires 
                         that Jefferson Smith no longer 
                         continue a member of this Body.

               There is dead silence in the chamber.

                                     CLERK'S VOICE
                              (as we see JEFF smiling 
                              courageously)
                         They therefore respectfully report 
                         this resoultion with the unanimous 
                         recommendation that the same do pass.

                                     CLERK
                              (seen in the full 
                              chamber)
                         Resolved: That Jefferson Smith be 
                         expelled from his seat in the Senate.

               There is continued dead silence in the chamber, then a Senator 
               rises.

                                     SENATOR
                         Mr. President, I move for the 
                         immediate adoption of the Resolution.

               In the PRESS GALLERY, SAUNDERS is now signaling frantically 
               to Jeff, and then Jefferson and another Senator leap to their 
               feet--calling out almost simultaneously:

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Mr. President!

                                     SENATOR
                         Mr. President!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I addressed the Chair first, sir!

                                     SENATOR
                         I am about to ask for a roll call on 
                         the passage of the Resolution--without 
                         further delay. The Senator can have 
                         nothing to say at this time that 
                         would not be either in bad grace or--

                                     PRESIDENT
                         However, Senator Smith is still a 
                         member of this Body and as such has 
                         equal claim on the attention of the 
                         Chair--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         You were about to recognize me, sir--

                                     PRESIDENT
                         That is merely your *impression*, 
                         Senator. The Chair has yet to settle 
                         the question to its own satisfaction!

               In the PRESS GALLERY, on a nudge from Saunders, Diz applauds 
               and yells:

                                     DIZ
                         Let him speak!

               SWEENEY AND FLOOD also applaud Diz's cry.

               In the VISITOR'S GALLERY, the Old Lady and Old Man are leaning 
               forward interestedly--eyes bright. This is fireworks. They 
               applaud, too, and immediately the sound grows all around 
               them from people in the gallery.

               In the SENATE CHAMBER, the PRESIDENT bangs his gavel and 
               looks up at the gallery.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (sharply)
                         Before proceeding, I should like to 
                         remind visitors that they are here 
                         as our guests--and ought to behave 
                         as such. I might add that their 
                         sentiment will certainly in no wise 
                         affect the judgment of this Chair.

               He pauses and glares out over the Senate.

               JEFFERSON is seen waiting for the chair's ruling--holding 
               his breath. There is a dead pause, during which Jeff and the 
               contending Senator are on their feet. Suddenly, the President 
               whips his gavel up and out, like a referee saying "In that 
               corner--!"

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (barking)
                         The chair recognizes Senator--Smith!

               A wave of excited relief sweeps the chamber, while in the 
               PRESS GALLERY, SAUNDERS' tense face is thawing out fast.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (a smile breaking 
                              over his face)
                         I thank you, sir.

               He glances up at Saunders, who smiles back at him.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (addressing the chair)
                         Well--seems like some of the gentlemen 
                         are in a pretty tall hurry to have 
                         me out of here. The way the evidence 
                         stacks up against me, I can't say I 
                         blame 'em. But, hurry or no hurry, 
                         sir--I've got a few things to say 
                         before I leave. I tried saying 'em 
                         in here the other day and was stopped 
                         colder'n a mackerel. Well, I'm going 
                         to get them said now--in fact, you 
                         might as well know, I'm not letting 
                         myself be expelled from this Chamber 
                         until I do.

               There is a hum in the Chamber and the gavel pounds. Paine is 
               on his feet.

                                     PAINE
                              (above the noise)
                         Mr. President! Will the Senator yield?

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (to Jeff)
                         Will Senator Smith yield to--?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (breaking in--loudly 
                              and positively)
                         *No*, sir! I'm afraid not!

               A sudden, astounded quiet.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I yielded the floor the other day, 
                         if you remember--and was practically 
                         never heard of again.

               A ripple from the gallery. The President pounds his gavel.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         *No*, sir! And we might as well get 
                         together on this "yielding" right 
                         off the bat. I had some pretty good 
                         coaching last night and I find that 
                         if I yield only for a question, a 
                         point of order, or a personal 
                         privilege, I can hold this floor a 
                         little short of doomsday. In other 
                         words, I've got a *piece* to speak--
                         and blow hot or cold, I'm going to 
                         speak it.
                              (Then--plunging on)
                         Mr. President--up on your desk there 
                         is a final conference report on a 
                         Deficiency Bill--waiting to be passed. 
                         Well, I'm here to tell you that one 
                         section of it is nothing but a 
                         barefaced thievery--a piece of graft--
                         !

               A hum goes up; the gavel pounds--and Paine has leaped to his 
               feet.

                                     PAINE
                              (strongly)
                         Will the Senator yield?

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (pounding again)
                         Order!
                              (To Jeff)
                         Will Senator Smith yield to--?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (breaking in)
                         Yield *how*, sir?

                                     PAINE
                         Will he yield for a question?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Ah, now, that's better.

                                     PAINE
                              (angrily)
                         Will he *yield*?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         For a *question*.

                                     PAINE
                         Does my colleague's piece concern 
                         Section Forty of the bill--a dam on 
                         Willet Creek?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         It does!

                                     PAINE
                         Every *aspect* of this matter--the 
                         gentleman's attack on that section--
                         everything--was dealt with in the 
                         committee hearing--

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (trying to break in)
                         Mr. President--

                                     PAINE
                              (continuing)
                         I wish to ask the gentleman--has he 
                         one shred of evidence to add now to 
                         the defense he did not give--and 
                         *could* not give at that same hearing?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (sharply)
                         I have no defense against forged 
                         papers and--

                                     PAINE
                              (breaking in)
                         The committee ruled otherwise! The 
                         gentleman stands guilty as charged. 
                         And I believe I speak for all the 
                         members when I say that no one cares 
                         to hear what a man of his condemned 
                         character has to say about *any* 
                         section of *any* legislation before 
                         this house!

               Some applause breaks out over the floor--and a commotion in 
               the gallery.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (pounds)
                         Order, gentlemen!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Mr. President--I stand guilty as 
                         *framed*! Because Section Forty is 
                         graft, and I was ready to say so. I 
                         was ready to tell you that one man 
                         in my state--Mister James Taylor--
                         was putting that dam through for his 
                         own profit!

               A hum of excitement, and the gavel pounds. We get glimpses 
               of Taylor's reaction and Paine's growing dread of this 
               outburst.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (raising his voice)
                         A man who controls a political machine--
                         and everything else worth controlling 
                         in that state--powerful enough to 
                         buy men and put them in this Congress 
                         to legislate his graft! I saw three 
                         of those men--when Mister Taylor 
                         came here to see me.

               Paine is up again.

                                     PAINE
                         Will the Senator--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I will not yield, sir! This same man--
                         Mister Taylor--came here to offer me 
                         a place in this Senate for twenty 
                         years, if I would vote for a dam 
                         that he knew and *I* knew was a 
                         *fraud*! But if I opened my mouth 
                         against it, he promised to break me 
                         in two! And I stood here one day and 
                         tried--I *started* to open my mouth--
                         and it all came to pass. The long, 
                         powerful arm of Mister James Taylor 
                         reached right into this sacred chamber 
                         and took me by the scruff of the 
                         neck--

               Paine is on his feet desperately.

                                     PAINE
                         Mr. President! A point of order!

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (trying to proceed)
                         Mr. President--

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (rasping)
                         Senator Paine will state it!

                                     PAINE
                         It was *I* who rose in this Chamber 
                         to accuse him. He is saying that I 
                         was carrying out criminal orders on 
                         falsified evidence--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Mr. President--

                                     PAINE
                         He has imputed to me conduct unworthy 
                         a Senator--and I demand he be made 
                         to yield the floor--!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Mr. President--I did not say that 
                         Senator Paine was one of those 
                         Congressmen I saw. If the chair 
                         please, I will deny that Senator 
                         Paine *saw* Taylor or even knows him--

                                     PAINE
                         I *did* see Taylor! And I was in 
                         that room!

               An uproar all over the house. Gavel pounds.

                                     PAINE
                              (raising his voice 
                              above noise)
                         I accuse this man--by his tone--by 
                         his careful denials--he is 
                         deliberately trying to plant damaging 
                         impressions of my conduct--! *I'll* 
                         tell you why we were in tht room. 
                         Because Mr. Taylor, a respected 
                         citizen of our State, had brought 
                         with him the evidence against this 
                         man, later presented from this floor, 
                         and *we were urging him to resign*--
                         !

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (banging)
                         Order!

                                     PAINE
                         --to avoid bringing disgrace upon a 
                         clean and honorable State!

               Jeff now listens in amazement--stunned by the desperate, 
               fighting lies of Paine.

                                     PAINE
                              (pitching on)
                         But he refused. He threatened to 
                         bring that very disgrace down upon 
                         the State and all of us--if we did 
                         not let him go through with his 
                         contemptible scheme!

               More commotion.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Order!

                                     PAINE
                              (shouting)
                         Finally, there was only one answer 
                         to a man like him--the truth--which 
                         I rose and gave to this body!
                              (Rising to emphatic, 
                              desperate strength)
                         Mr. President--he has told lie upon 
                         lie--every lie a desperate attempt 
                         to conceal his own guilt. And now, 
                         he is trying to blackmail this Senate--
                         as he tried to blackmail me! To 
                         prevent his expulsion, he would 
                         probably even try to hold up this 
                         Deficiency Bill--vital to the whole 
                         country--which must be passed 
                         immediately--*today*! *Anything*--to 
                         force you to clear his bad name and 
                         save his hide!
                              (Then)
                         Gentlemen--I--I have no more patience 
                         with this--this *rascally* character. 
                         I apologize to this body for his 
                         appointment--I regret I had ever 
                         known him. I--I'm sick and tired of 
                         this contemptible young man and I 
                         refuse to listen to him any longer! 
                         I hope every member of this body 
                         feels as I do!

               With that, Paine walks quickly to the cloakroom door--and 
               out. Applause breaks out. The President does not try to compel 
               order for a second. Cries break out--from gallery and floor.

                                     CRIES
                         Get off the floor! 
                         Yield! 
                         Yield!

               Boos commence, and we get glimpses of Saunders and the newsmen--
               watching Jeff in this tight spot--and of Taylor and McGann, 
               with hope in their eyes. Then Senators pop up.

                                     SENATOR
                         Give up this disgraceful stand--and 
                         quit the floor!

                                     ANOTHER SENATOR
                         The resolution to expel!

                                     ANOTHER ONE
                         Yield the floor!

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (pounding)
                         Please address the Chair--

               Cries of "yield" as the gavel raps.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (above the tumult)
                         Mr. President--the gentlemen want me 
                         to yield! Well--I *would*, sir--on 
                         one condition. These gentlemen won't 
                         believe me--but the people of my 
                         State will. I want to go back and 
                         tell *them* this story. I want one 
                         week--and until I get back here and 
                         tell you what *they* say--and bring 
                         you proof that I'm right--I want the 
                         Senate's word that I won't be expelled 
                         and that Deficiency Bill will not be 
                         passed!

               An uprising of men and gavel pounds.

                                     SENATOR
                         Will the Senator yield?

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (staunchly)
                         For a question!

                                     SENATOR
                         Has the gentleman the effrontery--
                         standing there convicted and in 
                         disgrace--to try to force the 
                         postponement of that bill--?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         For one week!

                                     SENATOR
                         Is he fully aware that this bill has 
                         been months in both Houses--delayed 
                         and delayed--millions will be without 
                         food and shelter until its passage--
                         public works to relieve unemployment 
                         will be at a standstill--government 
                         agencies will be forced to suspend--
                         ?

                                     ANOTHER
                         This is unthinkable and an outrage!

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Order!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The outrage is Section Forty!

                                     A SENATOR
                         Mr. President! If the Senate yields 
                         to this form of blackmail--from *this* 
                         man--and *this* time--it will become 
                         a laughing stock--

                                     ANOTHER SENATOR
                         Mr. President! It's an insult to 
                         this body to be asked to listen. An 
                         insult to our colleague, Senator 
                         Paine. I, for one, will follow the 
                         Senator's example and refuse to remain 
                         in this Chamber as long as this man 
                         holds the floor!

               The Senator starts for the exit--many members, with cries of 
               agreement, rise and start to move with him. The gavel pounds.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Gentlemen!

               JEFFERSON is seen watching the member's progress toward the 
               exits. His attitude is grim and steadfast. After a moment, 
               he starts deliberately and calmly to pull small packages and 
               a thermos bottle out of his bulging pockets.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (raising his voice)
                         Well then, sir--I guess I'll just 
                         have to talk to the people of my 
                         State from here.

               In the Senate, the members continue out--and the gallery 
               leans over to see Jeff calmly continuing to take his packages 
               out.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         And I know *one* thing--wild horses 
                         aren't going to drag me off this 
                         floor till those people've heard 
                         everything I've got to say. Not if 
                         it takes all winter.

               There is some applause in portions of the gallery, while we 
               get glimpses of departing Senators--of gallery characters--
               of Saunders, thrilled, and excited--of Taylor and McGann, 
               who rise and start out. In the PRESS GALLERY, men go tumbling 
               up the stairs, and then break into the PRESS ROOM, shouting.

                                     REPORTERS
                         Filibuster! 
                         Wow! 
                         Filibuster!

               In the CHAMBER, emptying of Senators, Jeff is finishing 
               arranging his desk and the President is pounding for order.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, sir. I'll go right on blasting 
                         from here--and if I know those people--
                         when I'm through--they'll rear up 
                         and kick Mister Taylor's machine to 
                         kingdom come.

               He looks up to SAUNDERS. She indicates the departing Senators, 
               and holds up the Senate Manual.

               JEFFERSON, catching her signal, picks up the manual, and 
               looks at the empty chamber.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Uh--Mr. President--you and I are 
                         about to be alone in here, sir. I'm 
                         not complaining for social reasons, 
                         but it'd be a pity if the gentlemen 
                         missed any of this.
                              (Then, referring to 
                              his manual--in a 
                              business-like tone)
                         Mr. President--I call the chair's 
                         attention to Rule Five of the Standing 
                         Rules of the Senate Section Three. 
                         "If it shall be found that a quorum 
                         is not present, a majority of the 
                         Senators present--," and that begins 
                         to look like me--"may direct the 
                         Sergeant-at-arms to request, and if 
                         necessary *compel* the attendance of 
                         the absent Senators."
                              (Then-stoutly)
                         Mr. President--*I so direct*.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (to the Secretary of 
                              the Minority)
                         Ring the call to quorum.

               The quorum bell is sounded. Jeff remains standing.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         No hurry, sir--I've got plenty of 
                         time--

               The quorum bell sounds again.

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE PRESS ROOM, as SAUNDERS 
               tears up to Diz and grabs him. (In the background, is an 
               unholy chatter of typewriters and the jabber of men 
               telephoning their stories to the papers, with snatches heard 
               like: "--sensational story of graft--"; "--hang on all winter--
               won't let bill pass till Taylor machine is blasted--.")

                                     SAUNDERS
                         The war's on!

                                     DIZ
                         He's a house-afire!

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Diz--get what he says to the people 
                         back in that State. It's up to you 
                         and the boys. Keep those wires hot. 
                         Fire away, pal!

               And impulsively she kisses him a smack on the cheek and runs 
               off. Diz looks after her in a foolish daze. The background 
               of boys phoning their stories in, rises to a pitch--as we 
               dissolve to newspaper headlines, and then again to HOPPER'S 
               EXECUTIVE OFFICE, with Happy Hopper at his desk, on the phone, 
               as three of his boys come charging in, waving newspapers.

                                     HUBERT
                              (into phone)
                         Amazing! Fantastic!

                                     THE BOYS
                         Pop! 
                         Jeff's after 'em! 
                         Filibuster!

                                     HUBERT
                              (to boys)
                         Silence!

                                     JIMMIE
                         When Jeff gets through with Taylor, 
                         Pop--

                                     HUBERT
                              (into the phone; by 
                              mistake)
                         When Jeff gets through with Taylor--
                              (Breaking off, turning 
                              viciously on boys)
                         Quiet! What do you mean by breaking 
                         in here--? Get out! Get *out* of 
                         here!

               He has risen and is driving the boys out.

               At the PET SHOP, REAR OF SMITH HOME, Ma is mixing pet food 
               at the center table--surrounded by boys waving papers 
               excitedly. The pets are in an uproar.

                                     BOYS
                         Whee! 
                         Ma, Jeff's tellin' 'em, Ma! 
                         Jeff's gonna talk till doomsday--! 
                         He's fightin' 'em, Ma--Jeff won't 
                         quit!

                                     MA
                              (calmly going about 
                              her business)
                         Well, well. Kinda *thought* Jeff 
                         wouldn't be comin' home so soon.

                                     VOICES
                         Comin' home--! 
                         Look, Ma--look! 
                         Read it!

               The scene dissolves to TAYLOR'S HOTEL SUITE, with Taylor, 
               Paine, Cook, Griffith and three Congressmen under great 
               nervous strain. Desks have been moved into the suite, 
               telephones are teletype are being installed.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (yelling)
                         Where's that Jackson City long 
                         distance?

                                     COOK
                              (placatingly)
                         Wait now--Hendricks stepped out--

                                     TAYLOR
                              (furiously)
                         Why isn't an editor at his desk where 
                         he belongs?

                                     PAINE
                         Jim--the boy's talking to that State--
                         the story is out--!

                                     TAYLOR
                              (viciously)
                         Sure! The fight's in the open now--
                         to a finish--!

                                     PAINE
                         And if he can raise public opinion 
                         against us--if any *part* of this 
                         sticks--

                                     TAYLOR
                         He won't get started! I'll *make* 
                         public opinion out there in five 
                         hours. I've done it all my life! 
                         I'll blacken this punk until--
                              (Breaking off)
                         Joe--your job is back in the Senate--
                         keep those men fighting him *there*.

                                     PAINE
                         I hit him from the floor with 
                         everything I knew!

                                     TAYLOR
                         Keep doing it! This is the whole 
                         works, Joe--we're out of business of 
                         bigger than we then we ever were. We 
                         can't miss a trick--we can't stop at 
                         *anything*--till this yokel's smashed 
                         up and buried so deep he'll never--!

               The phone rings, and Griffith picks it up.

                                     GRIFFITH
                              (into phone)
                         Yes--*yes*!
                              (To Taylor)
                         Jackson City--Hendricks!

                                     TAYLOR
                         Joe! Will you go back to that Senate!

               Paine turns abruptly and hurries out. Taylor grabs for the 
               phone.

                                     TAYLOR
                         Hendricks! Line up all the papers in 
                         the State! Don't print a word of 
                         what Smith says--not a word of any 
                         news story coming out of Washington! 
                         Understand? Defend the machine. *Hit* 
                         this guy! A criminal--convicted by 
                         Senate--blocking relief bill--starving 
                         the people. Start protests coming. 
                         Wires. Buy up every minute you can 
                         on every two-watt radio station in 
                         the State. Keep 'em spouting against 
                         Smith! McGann's flying out--be there 
                         in five hours. Stop your presses--
                         yank out the stories you got in 'em 
                         now--and get going--*get that whole 
                         State moving*--!

               In HENDRICK'S OFFICE:

                                     HENDRICKS
                         Okay, Jim. Goodbye.
                              (He hangs up the phone, 
                              then flips a 
                              dictograph key)
                         Stop the presses!

               The scene dissolves to the JACKSON CITY PRESS--a huge printing 
               press--slowing down--and men leaping on it and beginning to 
               tear out sheets being printed; then to a RADIO STATION where 
               a man is broadcasting.

                                     MAN
                         --Jefferson Smith is guilty! This 
                         filibuster is a cowardly attempt to 
                         turn your attention from the true 
                         facts--!

               We see ANOTHER MICROPHONE, at which another man is thundering:

                                     MAN
                              (foaming)
                         --it's an open-and-shut case! 
                         Jefferson Smith was--

               In MA SMITH'S SITTING ROOM, Ma is seen in a rocking chair, 
               surrounded by kids--some of whom hold papers. All are 
               listening to the radio--the voice of the preceding scene:

                                     RADIO VOICE
                              (continuing from above)
                         --caught red-handed--stealing from 
                         boys!

               A yowl goes up.

                                     BOYS
                              (wildly)
                         They're lying! 
                         A bunch of lies!

                                     RADIO VOICE
                              (continuing--but lost 
                              in uproar)
                         A Committee of the United States 
                         Senate found him guilty! Like the 
                         blackguard he is! He is trying to 
                         save what's left of his name--by 
                         attacking Joseph Paine, Willet Dam! 
                         He doesn't care what it may cost the 
                         people of this country--!

                                     BOYS
                              (continuing unbrokenly; 
                              waving paper)
                         Why don't they tell us what Jeff's 
                         saying! 
                         Yeah! What about Jeff? 
                         They can't say that! 
                         What's *Jeff* saying?

               We see ANOTHER MICROPHONE and a man broadcasting.

                                     MAN
                         --to gain his own contemptible ends, 
                         this man is blocking a bill--

               Then a ROOM, with a group of people--a family--listening.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                              (continuing from above)
                         --vital to you and this entire nation. 
                         Relief will be stopped! Men will be 
                         thrown out of jobs--!

               Through the last line of the above, the man of the family 
               yells:

                                     MAN
                         I always knew that Smith was a phoney!

               Then the HOPPER DINING ROOM, with the family at dinner. Four 
               of the boys are crowded around Happy Hopper, at the head of 
               the table, where a portable radio is blasting away.

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         --and to save his own hide, this is 
                         what Jefferson Smith is going to do! 
                         He's going to destroy everything 
                         Joseph Paine and his political party 
                         have done for this State. Joe Paine 
                         has brought us great Federal grants, 
                         prosperity--and now the Willet Dam. 
                         But Smith will destroy that, too--!

                                     KIDS
                         It's a lie! 
                         It's a dirty lie! 
                         Jeff never destroyed nothin'. 
                         What do you mean--'destroy'? 
                         How do you get that way?

                                     HAPPY
                              (yelling)
                         Quiet!

                                     EMMA
                              (distracted)
                         *Will you please sit down to dinner*!

                                     RADIO VOICE
                              (continuing)
                         Yes! Jefferson Smith will keep money 
                         out of this State, and work for 
                         thousands--with a deed and a signed 
                         contract against him.

                                     KIDS
                              (wildly)
                         It's a frame!... Why don't somebody 
                         *do* something?... You *know* it's a 
                         frame, Pop!... When ya gonna be a 
                         man and stop this dirty Taylor from--
                         ?

                                     HAPPY
                         Silence! I *am* a man!

               The butler has entered while the Radio voice has continued 
               with the following:

                                     RADIO VOICE
                         In other words, this man who couldn't 
                         get away with stealing money for 
                         himself, is going to take money away 
                         from you, but he will not get away 
                         with it. Citizens of this State know 
                         the facts. They will brand Jefferson 
                         Smith as he deserves!

                                     BUTLER
                              (raising his voice)
                         Mr. Taylor, calling from Washington, 
                         sir!

                                     HAPPY
                              (above the clamor)
                         What? Who?

                                     KIDS
                         Taylor, Pop! 
                         From Washington! 
                         Now is your chance, Pop!

               Happy switches off the radio and leaps up from the table, 
               rushing out of the dining room. The kids, with yells of 
               "Zowie," "Wow," and "Taylor, huh?"--rush out of the room 
               after Happy.

                                     EMMA
                              (calling after them)
                         Hubert! Boys!

               Now in TAYLOR'S HOTEL SUITE in Washington, Taylor is on the 
               phone, his coat off; in the background a battery of men, 
               phones, teletype machine, desks.

                                     TAYLOR
                              (into the phone)
                         Happy? What's the matter with you? 
                         *Collapsed*? McGann says you're 
                         sitting home! I want some action! 
                         Get into this!

               In the HOPPER LIBRARY, Happy is surrounded by the children, 
               shouting:

                                     KIDS
                         Go ahead--tell him, Pop! 
                         Talk up, Pop! 
                         Tell Taylor it's a frame! Tell him 
                         what you think! 
                         Tell him to go fly a kite!

                                     HAPPY
                              (into the phone)
                         Y-yes, Jim!
                              (To boys)
                         Please!

               In TAYLOR'S HOTEL SUITE:

                                     TAYLOR
                         What's the racket?--You heard me, 
                         Happy--stop stalling--*move*!

               He slams the receiver. Cook is waving a phone at him.

                                     COOK
                         Clark, Jim--

                                     TAYLOR
                              (grabbing the phone)
                         Clark?... Jim Taylor--in Washington. 
                         This Smith filibuster--your chain of 
                         papers in the Southwest must know 
                         that this bill he's blocking affects 
                         your section as well as any--it's 
                         the patriotic duty of every newspaper 
                         in the country to--

               In a SENATE CHAMBER, Paine, the Vice-President, and several 
               Senators are seen talking.

                                     FIRST SENATOR
                         I've seen filibustering, but this is--

                                     SECOND SENATOR
                         Gentlemen, this can't go on, it's 
                         ridiculous!

                                     THIRD SENATOR
                         Henry, we've got to get this man off 
                         the floor.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Boys, as long as Mr. Smith holds 
                         that floor legitimately, he's going 
                         to continue to hold it. If you ask 
                         me, that young fellow's making a 
                         whole lot of sense.

                                     PAINE
                         Sense. Do you call blackmail sense, 
                         Henry?

                                     FOURTH SENATOR
                         Now look, Joe, I didn't like this 
                         boy from the beginning, but most of 
                         us feel that no man who wasn't sincere 
                         could stage a fight like this against 
                         those impossible odds.

                                     PAINE
                         Well, I'm very glad to know that, 
                         Martin. After twenty years of working 
                         with you fellows, I'm very glad to 
                         know you're ready to take his word 
                         against mine. That's fine.

                                     SENATORS
                         Ridiculous! 
                         Nothing of the sort!

                                     PAINE
                         Oh, yes, that's what it means. If 
                         he's just that much right, I'm wrong.

                                     THIRD SENATOR
                         Joe, listen, can't we work out some 
                         deal to pull that Willet Dam out and 
                         let the Deficiency Bill go through?

                                     PAINE
                         It isn't a question of Willet Dam. 
                         It's a question of my honor and 
                         reputation and the integrity of the 
                         Committee on Privileges and Elections, 
                         the integrity of the Senate itself. 
                         Well, if you want to throw out Section 
                         forty, go ahead. I'll resign and 
                         we'll have the whole thing over with.

                                     SENATORS
                         Now, wait a minute, Joe. 
                         Wait, wait, wait.

                                     SECOND SENATOR
                         Wait a minute. This is a lot of 
                         nonsense. Joe's right. A deal's 
                         impossible. We've got to go on just 
                         as we've been doing and break him, 
                         keep him talking, no relief, maintain 
                         a quorum in relays. Is that how you 
                         feel, John?

                                     FIRST SENATOR
                         For once I agree with him. Gentlemen, 
                         it's time to relieve the men on the 
                         floor.

                                     FOURTH SENATOR
                         How can a man as green as that know 
                         as much as he does? He can't go on 
                         much longer.

               The scene dissolves to the SENATE CHAMBER at night, a crowded 
               chamber--the gallery full and attentive. Of the Senators, 
               some are at their desks, some with backs turned to Jefferson 
               and reading, a couple of them dozing, one with his head thrown 
               back and a newspaper over his face.

               Jeff is standing as his desk reading from the Senate Manual 
               in strong, positive tones.

               The Senators of the previous scene are entering the Chamber. 
               The Vice-President walks to his chair to relieve the Pro 
               Tem. As the Majority Leader walks to his desk, he signals to 
               several men who are to be relieved. These men rise and saunter 
               out. Some forty men, consequently, are in motion.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (reading)
                         "--We hold these truths to be self-
                         evident, that all men are created 
                         equal, that they are endowed by their 
                         Creator with certain unalienable 
                         Rights--"
                              (He breaks off, 
                              remarking the Senators 
                              relieving each other--
                              dryly)
                         Well--looks like the night shift's 
                         comin' on.

                                     PRESIDENT
                         The Senator will please suspend until 
                         order is restored in the chamber.

               A close view of JEFFERSON shows a slight strain after these 
               seven or eight hours of continuous talk. His collar is undone, 
               his beard has started to sprout. His eyes go back to his 
               book, and he continues his reading.

               A BROADCASTING STUDIO appears, revealing H. V. KALTENBORN at 
               the microphone.

                                     KALTENBORN
                         This is H. V. Kaltenborn speaking--
                         half of official Washington is here 
                         to see democracy's finest show--
                         Washington's uncontrolled filibuster. 
                         The right to talk your head off... 
                         The American privilege of free speech 
                         in it's most dramatic form... the 
                         least man in that chamber, once he 
                         gets and holds the floor by the rules, 
                         can hold it and talk as long as he 
                         can stand on his feet--providing 
                         always first, that he does not sit 
                         down, second that he does not leave 
                         the chamber or stop talking. The 
                         galleries are packed, and in the 
                         diplomatic gallery are the envoys of 
                         two dictator powers. They have come 
                         to see what they can't see at home--
                         democracy in action.

               The floor of the SENATE is seen again.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         "--certain Unalienable Rights--that 
                         among these are Life, Liberty and 
                         the Pursuit of Happiness. That to 
                         secure these rights, Governments are 
                         instituted among Men, deriving their 
                         just powers from the consent of the 
                         governed, that whenever any form of 
                         government becomes destructive of 
                         these ends, it is the Right of the 
                         People to alter or to abolish it, 
                         and to institute new government, 
                         laying its foundation on such 
                         principles and organizing its powers 
                         in such form, as to them shall seem 
                         most likely to effect their Safety 
                         and Happiness--"
                              (Finishing with a 
                              flourish and putting 
                              the book down)
                         Now, that's pretty swell, isn't it? 
                         I always get a great kick outa those 
                         parts of the Declaration--especially 
                         when I can read 'em out loud to 
                         somebody.

               He picks up the book and starts to walk with it--stretching 
               his legs to get the stiffness out.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (waving the book)
                         You see, that's what I had in mind 
                         about camp--except those men said it 
                         a little better than I can. Now, 
                         you're not gonna have a country that 
                         makes these kinds of rules *work*, 
                         if you haven't got men who've learned 
                         to tell human rights from a punch in 
                         the nose. And funny thing about men--
                         they start life being boys. That's 
                         why it seemed like a pretty good 
                         idea to take kids out of crowded 
                         cities and stuffy basements for a 
                         few months a year--and build their 
                         bodies and minds for a man-sized 
                         job. Those boys'll be sitting at 
                         these desks some day. Yes--it seemed 
                         a pretty good idea--boys coming 
                         together--all nationalities and ways 
                         of living--finding out what makes 
                         different people tick the way they 
                         do. 'Cause I wouldn't give you a red 
                         cent for *all* your fine rules, 
                         without there was some plain every-
                         day, common kindness under 'em--and 
                         a little looking-out for the next 
                         fella. Yes--pretty important, all 
                         that. Just happens to be blood and 
                         bone and sinew of this democracy 
                         that some great man handed down to 
                         the human race--! That's all! But, 
                         of course, if you need to build a 
                         dam where a camp like that ought to 
                         be--to make some graft and pay off 
                         your political army or something--
                         why, that's different!
                              (Suddenly--with 
                              strength)
                         No sir! If anybody here thinks I'm 
                         going back to those boys and say to 
                         'em: "Forget it, fellas. Everything 
                         I've told you about the land you 
                         live in is a lotta hooey. It isn't 
                         your country--it belongs to the James 
                         Taylors--!" No, sir, anybody that 
                         thinks that has got another think 
                         coming!
                              (He breaks off, and 
                              starts a different 
                              tune, apologetically)
                         I--I'm sorry to be coming back to 
                         that and--I'm sorry I have to stand 
                         here--it's pretty disrespectful to 
                         this honorable body. When I think--
                         this was where Clay and Calhoun and 
                         Webster spoke--Webster stood right 
                         here by this desk--why, in the first 
                         place--an' I hate to go on trying 
                         your patience like this--but--well, 
                         I'm either dead right or I'm *crazy*!

                                     A SENATOR
                              (looking back and 
                              calling out dryly)
                         You wouldn't care to put that to a 
                         vote, Senator?

               A ripple of laughter. The gavel pounds. Another Senator is 
               up.

                                     SENATOR
                         Will the Senator yield for a question?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I yield.

                                     SENATOR
                         In view of the gentleman's touching 
                         concern for the Senators, would he 
                         permit a motion to recess until the 
                         morning--at which time he could 
                         continue to educate this august body 
                         with his profound babblings?

               Jeff pauses. He looks up. Senators come up from under their 
               newspapers on the alert. Maybe this is the trick that 
               dislodges him.

               We see SAUNDERS, shaking her head, pointing Jeff's attention 
               to the Chair; then JEFF looking down from Saunders, then 
               around him suspiciously.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (addressing the Chair)
                         Well, now--I wouldn't know about 
                         that. Mr. President--what happens to 
                         me in the morning--I mean about my 
                         having this floor to go on babbling?

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (seen if a full view 
                              of the Chamber)
                         If the Senator permits this motion 
                         to recess he will not have the floor 
                         in the morning to babble or anything 
                         else, unless he is recognized first 
                         by the Chair.

               With a wise expression, Jeff picks up where he left off way 
               back. (Saunders and Diz leave the Press Gallery in this 
               scene.)

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I see, well, as I was saying, 
                         gentlemen--I'm either right or crazy. 
                         And I feel fine.

               The Senators go back under their newspapers. The ruse didn't 
               work.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         The people of my State have got both 
                         ears full by this time. They're 
                         probably rising up and starting here 
                         in droves just about now--so I think 
                         I'll go on talking until I hear from 
                         them.

                                     PAGE BOY
                         Here you are, Senator, from Miss 
                         Saunders.
                              (Hands Jeff the 
                              Constitution)

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Oh! Thanks.
                              (The Page Boy shows 
                              he still has on his 
                              ranger button)
                         Well, the Constitution of the United 
                         States--
                              (Reading)
                         Article one--section one.

               The scene dissolves to a STREET in JACKSON CITY, at night; 
               to a parade of which we see the torchlights and hear the 
               noise of bands and shouts. A huge banner is seen extended 
               across the marchers, reading:

                                       MASS MEETING
                                    Jackson City Hall

               This banner passes and another comes forward which reads: 
               PROTEST SMITH FILIBUSTER. Then we see the PUBLIC AUDITORIUM 
               at night, people jamming the entrance and milling around 
               outside. AT THE ENTRANCE, groups are seen being told that 
               the place is "full up," with no seats. Then we are in the 
               AUDITORIUM, where several prominent citizens are seated on 
               the platform, among them Happy Hopper. Happy mops his brow 
               in extreme discomfort. Kenneth Allen is addressing the 
               assembly, rabble-rousing.

                                     KENNETH ALLEN
                         He's a red-handed criminal, that 
                         Jefferson Smith, going to block that 
                         dam--keep money and employment out 
                         of your State--stop relief to starving 
                         millions! Are we going to let a 
                         scoundrel like that throw mud at a 
                         man like Joe Paine?

               A shout of "no!" is thrown back at him.

                                     ALLEN
                         Are you for Joe Paine?

               A yell goes up.

                                     ALLEN
                         Then *tell* him you are!

               Another cheer, and at this point, somewhere in the AUDITORIUM, 
               a youngster yells down with all his might:

                                     KID
                         Hurray for Jeff Smith!

               But simultaneously with his yelling, and right at the end of 
               the cheer, the band strikes up "Stars and Stripes Forever." 
               The kids are drowned out and almost immediately are seized 
               by the scruff of the neck, hands clasped over their mouths, 
               and dragged out. The scene dissolves to HEADLINES flying up 
               to screen, capping Allen's request:

                                           WIRE
                                  CONGRESS! STOP SMITH!

               This dissolves to the JACKSON CITY PRESS OFFICE, with MCGANN 
               at a desk, surrounded by a few other men.

                                     MCGANN
                              (talking excitedly 
                              into the phone)
                         We're burnin' 'em up, Jim! Got every 
                         paper in the state tied up except 
                         the Clarkville Courier up near 
                         Sweetwater.

               In TAYLOR'S HOTEL SUITE in Washington:

                                     TAYLOR
                         Well, buy it--or *wreck* it!

               In the SENATE UPPER CORRIDOR, SAUNDERS AND DIZ are pushing 
               out of one of the gallery doors and through the crowd; Diz 
               has Saunders by the hand.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (in alarm)
                         What is it, Diz?

               He stops with her in a relatively uncrowded spot.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (again)
                         Diz!

                                     DIZ
                              (excitedly)
                         Kid--he thinks he's talking to that 
                         mob at home, but not a line we've 
                         written--not a word he's said from 
                         that floor has gotten into that home 
                         State.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         What!

                                     DIZ
                         Not a word! Taylor's sewed up every 
                         paper. They're tossing out everything 
                         that comes in over the wires!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (exploding)
                         Freedom of the press! Mr. James Taylor 
                         blindfolding a whole State--
                              (Then suddenly)
                         Wait a minute! If that's how he wants 
                         to play *I'll* get through to that 
                         bunch--I'll get plenty of words into 
                         that, State--!
                              (Grabbing Diz)
                         Come on, Diz, get that stuff you've 
                         written--let me have it--

               She pulls him along quickly.

               The scene dissolves to JEFFERSON'S OFFICE at night, with 
               Saunders on the phone--a sheaf of papers in her hand, Diz 
               alongside.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (eagerly)
                         Hello! Hello! Mrs. Smith? This is 
                         Saunders, in Washington... Yes--
                         Saunders--that's right. Listen...oh, 
                         he's fine--great. Don't you worry. 
                         Ma--look--Jeff has a paper there--
                         "Boy Stuff," that's right. Well, 
                         look--they aren't letting what Jeff 
                         says into the State. If I give you a 
                         raft of it over the phone now, will 
                         you print it up and spread a billion 
                         copies of it?--Swell! Take this down, 
                         Ma, will you?

               In MA SMITH'S SITTING ROOM, Ma is on the phone, several boys 
               around her. (A clock here shows the hour to be about 10:21.)

                                     MA
                              (turning from the 
                              phone)
                         Boys--everything about Jeff--get 
                         pencils and paper!

               With a yowl the boys scramble around.

                                     MA
                              (into the phone--with 
                              a smile)
                         One second--*Clarissa*!

               The boys pile around with pads and pencils.

                                     BOYS
                         Okay, Ma!

                                     MA
                              (into the phone)
                         Shoot, Clarissa!

               And little Bobby, with a bugle, raises it and blows a 
               tremendous, exultant blast!

               The scene dissolves to a MONTAGE presentation of the conflict 
               between the Taylor-McGann press and the youngsters' press: 
               First Saunders is on the phone, reading material to Ma.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         --the Willet Dam is a graft to line 
                         the pockets of the Taylor machine. 
                         Taylor has bought off Congressmen 
                         for years and has systematically 
                         robbed the people. He offered Jeff a 
                         seat in the Senate for life if he 
                         would vote as he was told.

               This is contrasted with Taylor, with a sheaf of papers in 
               his hand, reading over the phone:

                                     TAYLOR
                         --Chick--I want the whole morning 
                         edition a blast to push him off the 
                         floor! Campaign for protests--wires! 
                         Here's your front page editorial: "A 
                         convicted thief, representing you, 
                         holds the floor of the United States 
                         Senate--"

               From the above starts by Saunders and Taylor there follow 
               the words of Saunders being taken down on a broken little 
               portable typewriter, by one of the kids, with other kids 
               bringing him sheets of paper in longhand.

               Contrasted is McGann listening in, while beside him a couple 
               of men with earphones pound professionally at typewriters. 
               The sheets are grabbed out of their rollers by runners who 
               tear out of the office with them.

               We see the kids setting type laboriously.

               Contrasted are linotypists of the Jackson City Press.

               The kids cut their paper to size on a little hand apparatus.

               Contrasted, we see the huge rolls of paper being set in the 
               giant presses.

               We see the kids composing and locking their type in little 
               flats.

               Contrasted are the moulds being put into place on the Jackson 
               City Press rollers.

               We see the little press starting up, hand fed, and pumping 
               out one little circular at a time.

               Contrasted is the whirling giant press rattling out at trip-
               hammer speed.

               Back to the little press, pumping out boldly printed 
               circulars; with headlines that read:

                                  PEOPLE OF THIS STATE!
                                    READ JEFF'S STORY

                                JEFF SMITH SPEAKS TO YOU!

                                SMASH THE TAYLOR MACHINE!

                               JEFF SMITH IS FIGHTING GRAFT

               Contrasted is the whirling Jackson City Press. Over it 
               headlines flash up:

                             SMITH FORCING NATION TO CRISIS!

                                       STOP SMITH!

                                         PROTEST!

               Then a CARTOON is seen depicting Jeff with a little whiskbroom 
               sweeping back an ocean labelled "PUBLIC CONDEMNATION."

               Then another cartoon showing a line of haggard people at a 
               window marked "RELIEF FUNDS." A man at the window holds up 
               his hand, palm out, and says: "Sorry, Jefferson Smith is 
               still talking."

               Back to kids who are stacking and tying bundles of circulars.

               Contrasted, we see the professional stacking and tying of an 
               army of workers in the Jackson City Press rooms. (Perhaps 
               showing a change of shifts--fresh men coming in, as the gong 
               sounds and shows that it is five o'clock in the morning.)

               Back in the Smith home, with the kids still active and the 
               press still going. Ma is giving the kids coffee. One kid is 
               bobbing at a desk. A big boy is putting a little fellow, 
               sound asleep, down on a bed.

               The scene dissolves to bobbing Senators at their desks in 
               the United States Senate. JEFF is seen still talking. His 
               hair is disheveled, he is weary in the joint, with black 
               circles under his eyes, collar open. Jeff is saying:

                                     JEFFERSON
                         --there just can't be any compromise 
                         with inalienable rights like life 
                         and liberty. That's about the only 
                         thing I know for sure--and that's 
                         about all I got up on this floor to 
                         say--when was it? A year ago, it 
                         seems like--

               Further impressionistic views of the Chamber: the clock, 
               more sleeping attitudes of the Senators, a weary Vice-
               President Pro Tem, the sprinkling of people in the gallery, 
               made up of the night or early morning birds such as a fellow 
               in top hat and muffler, a milkman, a street car conductor.

               Back to all sorts of little vehicles--play wagons, bicycles, 
               scooters, etc.--collected in Jeff's back yard as piles of 
               circulars are carried out and loaded on these contraptions. 
               Some of the kids are starting away with their bundles. The 
               bugle note sounds over the scene.

               Contrasted, at the Jacskon City Press, the morning extra is 
               being loaded on big, handsome trucks which roar away.

               Then the distribution of the reading matter by both Taylor's 
               press and the kids'. We see Taylor's trucks dumping bundles 
               at street corners to newsboys.

               Jeff's kids race down residence blocks throwing circulars on 
               lawns, passing them out on business streets, shoving them 
               into people's hands--at crowded street corners, at factory 
               entrances.

               Taylor's newspaper boys are interspersed, hawking their 
               papers. (End of the montage.)

               In the JACKSON CITY PRESS OFFICE, McGann is on the phone, 
               with men rushing into him with copy.

                                     MCGANN
                              (shouting)
                         That's right, get out every piece of 
                         loud speaker equipment on wheels--!

               He is interrupted by a man who rushes in with some leaflets 
               in his hand.

                                     MAN
                         Chick, Chick, look--"Boy Stuff" 
                         circulars--peddled by nine million 
                         kids--

                                     MCGANN
                              (grabbing the leaflets, 
                              yelling)
                         Well, what are you standin' for? Get 
                         the boys out! Kill it!

               The scene dissolves to RESIDENCE BLOCKS, three episodes, 
               showing a couple of kids rushing along with a wagon full of 
               circulars and other kids taking from it to distribute them. 
               A big open truck swerves up to the curb. A couple of men 
               rush out, push the kids away from the little wagon, grab the 
               circulars, and toss them into the truck. The kids raise a 
               hue and cry and pile on. A quick free-for-all in which the 
               kids are sent sprawling--a smack to the jaw, a kick.

               This dissolves to A SLUM LOCATION: A large truck is loaded 
               with signs, is surrounded by shabbily-dressed men. McGann is 
               on hand, with a fist full of money. Signs are being passed 
               down to the waiting men and, as each takes one, McGann slips 
               a bill into his hand and he hurries off with a sign. The 
               signs carry these appeals: "STOP SMITH!" "WIRE CONGRESS!" 
               "STOP SMITH--WE WANT TO EAT." "CRIMINAL SMITH TALKS AND 
               AMERICANS STARVE!" "HERO JOSEPH PAINE." "JOE PAINE SAVED 
               YOUR STATE."

               Then we see an overlapping series of posters going up--a 
               banner being hoisted over a street. Men pasting up huge twenty-
               four sheets and three sheets--and little cards tacked to 
               telegraph poles and sides of buildings. They read: "STOP 
               SMITH! WIRE CONGRESS." A piece of bunting, folded up, suddenly 
               is pulled open to reveal STOP SMITH! Now we are in a STREET 
               at the front end of a small but boisterous parade, composed 
               principally of adults with a sprinkling of kids. Both adults 
               and a few children, flanking the marchers, play instruments. 
               There are banners at the end of the parade which read: "DOWN 
               WITH GRAFT--AND TAYLOR!"

               "SMASH THE TAYLOR MACHINE!"--"SMITH IS FIGHTING YOUR BATTLE!" 
               "JEFF SMITH WAS FRAMED!" "HAVE JEFF SMITH AND A CLEAN STATE!"

               Suddenly, those in the forefront look off in horror as almost 
               simultaneously they are hit by a might stream of water. We 
               see a fire truck and hoses pouring water, held by a couple 
               of firemen, with the aid of a plug-ugly. There are glimpses 
               of people as they are swept off their feet and whirled 
               violently on the ground. Simultaneously a calliope is heard. 
               Down the street comes the truck pulling a tremendous poster 
               on which is printed; "STOP JEFF (JUDAS) SMITH!" This truck, 
               with calliope playing, moves through what remains of the 
               parade. A loud speaker attached, bawls out:

                                     LOUD SPEAKER VOICE
                         Stop Smith! Remove this scoundrel 
                         from the Senate! Wire Congress!

               This dissolves to a CORNER. A soap box is surrounded by a 
               small group which is in the act of forming.

                                     SOAP BOXER
                              (yelling)
                         Smith was framed! Don't believe the 
                         papers! James Taylor owns them.
                              (Waves a circular)
                         If you want the truth, read--

               The small group is rushed by some professional hoodlums. 
               They charge through the group and the soap boxer is dragged 
               from his perch. At this instant a screaming siren is 
               overheard. People pause to look up. Then a MOVING AIRPLANE 
               is seen, with siren screaming, pulling a streamer on which 
               are the the letters: "STOP SMITH! WIRE CONGRESS!"

                                     LOUD SPEAKER VOICE
                         Stop Smith! It's the duty of every 
                         citizen--

               Various groups of people in the streets are looking up--people 
               raising their windows to look out, people rushing out of 
               doors from factories and public building as the loud speaker 
               continues:

                                     LOUD SPEAKER VOICE
                         --to wire Congress! Put Smith out of 
                         the Senate! Pass the Deficiency Bill. 
                         Wire Congress--in the name of the 
                         needy and hungry Americans!

               But in a STREET, there appears the car of the Governor's 
               children, and it is pulling a trailer on which small hand-
               painted posters lean against each other. These posters bear 
               the words: "STAND BEHIND JEFF" and "READ WHAT TAYLOR'S PAPERS 
               WON'T PRINT." The Governor's kids are recognized in this car 
               and also the little boy with the bugle who is playing one 
               continuous blast. The kids are throwing circulars to the 
               left and right as they move down the street. Suddenly a big 
               touring car with some plug uglies in it bears down with a 
               roar on this little trailer. They run into it--gasoline is 
               either poured on it or the gasoline tank is drilled with a 
               bullet and a match is set to the whole works. The trailer 
               and the car go up in a blaze as the kids scramble out to 
               save their lives.

               The scene dissolves to the HOPPER EXECUTIVE OFFICE, in which 
               Hubert is on the phone, raging:

                                     HUBERT
                         Are you Commissioner of Safety or--? 
                         *Hoodlums*! Taylor's hoodlums are 
                         running riot in the streets! Even 
                         children are not safe--hospitals are 
                         filled! I won't stand for this 
                         violence--

               And in the SMITH HOME, the place is still whirling. The kids 
               are working away. One of them is speaking into an amateur 
               radio excitedly--with a circular in his hands.

                                     KID
                              (on radio)
                         Fellas--tell your folks--the Taylor 
                         machine is framing Jeff Smith! Here's 
                         Jeff's story--put it down--!

               He breaks off as shouts are heard outside. About three 
               gorillas are pushing their way into the office. A group of 
               kids has evidently been fighting them from the time they 
               entered the house. The kids are yelling: "What do you want 
               in here?" "Who are you?" "Get out of here!" The men throw 
               off the kids and advance to both the press and the amateur 
               radio. One of them takes a small object that looks like a 
               hand grenade out of his pocket and hurls it at the press. 
               There is an explosion. The men duck and run. A couple of 
               kids clutch their faces and scream. The press stops. 
               Simultaneously one of the other gorillas has thrown himself 
               at the amateur radio. He starts pulling it apart.

               Next MA is on the phone.

                                     MA
                              (frantically)
                         Saunders! Is that you, Saunders?

               And we see SAUNDERS on the phone.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Yes, Ma!
                              (She listens)
                         What!

               In the SMITH HOME:

                                     MA
                              (wildly)
                         Yes! Bombs--acid! Children hurt! All 
                         over the city! Tell Jeff to stop! 
                         It's no use. They--they'll just kill 
                         *him* if he goes on--and everybody 
                         else! It isn't worth it, Saunders--

               SAUNDERS is seen paralyzed, holding the receiver as Ma's 
               voice screeches through.

                                     MA'S VOICE
                         *Tell him to stop*!

               H. V. KALTENBORN is seen again, broadcasting.

                                     KALTENBORN
                         Senator Smith has now talked for 
                         twenty-three hours and sixteen 
                         minutes. It is the most unusual and 
                         spectacular thing in the Senate 
                         annals. One lone and simple American 
                         holding the greatest floor in the 
                         land. What he lacked in experience 
                         he's made up in fight. But those 
                         tired Boy Ranger legs are buckling; 
                         bleary eyes, voice gone, he can't go 
                         on much longer and all official 
                         Washington is here to be in on the 
                         kill.

               In the SENATE PRESS GALLERY, Saunders and Diz are seen.

                                     JEFFERSON'S VOICE
                         No, sir, there's no compromise with 
                         truth. That's all I got up on this 
                         floor to say--when was it--a year 
                         ago, it seems like.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Diz, I'm afraid. Terrible things are 
                         happening. I've got to stop him.

                                     DIZ
                         They're listening to him. Anything 
                         might happen now.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Just get up off the ground, that's 
                         all I ask. Get up there with that 
                         lady that is up on top of this Capitol 
                         dome--that lady that stands for 
                         liberty, take a look at this country 
                         through her eyes if you really want 
                         to see something and you won't just 
                         see scenery--you'll see the whole 
                         parade of what man's carved out for 
                         himself after centuries of fighting 
                         and fighting for something better  
                         than just jungle law, fighting so's 
                         he can stand on his own two feet--
                         free and decent, like he was created--
                         no matter what his race, color or 
                         creed. That's what you'll see. There's 
                         no place out there for graft or greed 
                         or lies or compromise with human 
                         liberties. And if that's what the 
                         grown-ups have done to this world 
                         that was given to them we'd better 
                         get those boy's camps started fast 
                         and see what the kids can do and it 
                         is not too late because this country 
                         is bigger than the Taylors, or you 
                         or me, or anything else. Great 
                         principles don't get lost once they 
                         come to light. They're right here. 
                         You just have to see them.

                                     PAINE
                              (rising at his desk)
                         Mr. President, will the Senator yield 
                         for a question?

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Will Senator Smith yield to his 
                         colleague?

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, sir, I yield for a question.

                                     PAINE
                         The gentleman has said repeatedly 
                         that he is speaking to the people of 
                         his State. He has been waiting, as 
                         he so fancifully puts it, for them 
                         to come marching here in droves. 
                         Would the gentleman be interested in 
                         knowing what those people have to 
                         say?

               In the PRESS GALLERY:

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Here it comes, Diz.

               On the FLOOR again:

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Yes, sir, you bet I would.

                                     PAINE
                         Mr. President, have I permission to 
                         bring into this Chamber evidence of 
                         the response from my State?

                                     PRESIDENT
                         Is there objection?
                              (There is none)
                         You may proceed, Senator.

                                     PAINE
                         Page boys!

               Now a number of page boys enter, carrying down and placing 
               before the President's ROSTRUM many WIRE BASKETS, filled 
               with telegrams. The view picks out SAUNDERS.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         I can't stand it, Diz. I can't stand 
                         to see him hurt like this.

                                     A MAN
                         Public opinion made to order.

                                     DIZ
                         Yeah, Taylor made.

               SENATOR PAINE walks down and points to the baskets.

               There it is, there's the gentleman's answer. Telegrams, five 
               thousand of them, demanding that he yield the floor. I invite 
               the Senate to read them. I invite my colleague to read them. 
               The people's answer to Mr. Jefferson Smith.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (seen getting up and 
                              screaming)
                         Stop, Jeff, stop!
                              (Her voice is lost in 
                              the tumult)

               JEFFERSON has gone wearily to the baskets. He seizes handfulls 
               of telegrams at random and glances at them. He sags in 
               despair, almost falling.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (with effort)
                         I guess this is just another lost 
                         cause, Mr. Paine. All you people 
                         don't know about lost causes. Mr. 
                         Paine does. He said once they were 
                         the only causes worth fighting for, 
                         and he fought for them once, for the 
                         only reason that any man ever fights 
                         for them. Because of just one plain, 
                         simple rule, "Love thy neighbor," 
                         and in this world today, full of 
                         hatred, a man who knows that one 
                         rule has a great trust. You knew 
                         that rule, Mr. Paine, and I loved 
                         you for it, just as my father did. 
                         And you know that you fight for the 
                         lost causes harder than for any 
                         others. Yes, you'd even die for them, 
                         like a man we both know, Mr. Paine. 
                         You think I'm licked. You all think 
                         I'm licked. Well, I'm not licked and 
                         I'm going to stay right here and 
                         fight for this lost cause even if 
                         this room gets filled with lies like 
                         these, and the Taylors and all their 
                         armies come marching into this place. 
                         Somebody'll listen to me--some--

               The chamber whirls in front of Jeff's eyes--and he pitches 
               forward to the floor. People get to their feet automatically 
               all over the house--and there is dead silence except for 
               SAUNDERS, who utters one shriek as she gets to her feet--
               then stands unable to move.

               Then PAINE rises stiffly--his face a complete blank--and 
               starts toward the cloak room, several feet away.

               The tense, silent shock of the Senate floor is broken and 
               men start for Jeff's inert form. A tumult goes up, and 
               JEFFERSON is seen inert--completely gone--as men surround 
               him. And then--suddenly--off-scene--a pistol shot is heard. 
               Heads turn violently in the direction of the cloak room. 
               Women scream.

               In the CLOAK ROOM, near the door to the Chamber, Paine is 
               now struggling with three or four men, who wrest a revolver 
               out of Paine's hand. In violent desperation, Paine tears 
               himself loose and rushes for the chamber.

               In THE CHAMBER Paine comes toward the center aisle. (Jefferson 
               still lying face down on the floor.)

                                     PAINE
                              (crying out to the 
                              Chair)
                         Expel *me*! Not him. *Me*!

               He continues toward the chair as he talks--a man distracted--
               the whole house on its feet.

                                     PAINE
                         Willet Dam is a fraud! It's a crime 
                         against the people who sent me here--
                         and *I* committed it!

               PAINE walks mechanically toward the chair.

                                     PAINE
                              (shouting)
                         Every word that boy said is the truth! 
                         I'm not fit for office! I'm not fit 
                         for any place of honor or trust in 
                         this land! Expel me--!

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (wildly, clutching 
                              Diz)
                         He did it.

                                     DIZ
                         Wait a minute. I've got to write 
                         this story.

                                     PRESIDENT
                              (pounding vainly with 
                              his gavel)
                         Order, gentlemen, please.

                                     DIZ
                              (to Saunders)
                         Will you please let go of me.

                                     SAUNDERS
                              (screaming)
                         He did it! Yippee!

               The scene dissolves to the HOPPER KIDS, a newspaper between 
               them--and just yelling at the tops of their lungs:

                                     BOYS
                         Yeow!

               And this is followed by a BONFIRE SCENE, with Boy Rangers 
               leaping and yelling; and then we see the WINDOW of the offices 
               of the JACKSON CITY PRESS at night, where a rock goes crashing 
               through the window, smashing it to smithereens.

               This dissolves to HOPPER'S EXECUTIVE OFFICE, in which HOPPER 
               is surrounded by Edwards and the other members of the 
               Citizen's Committee. Happy is a lion at bay.

                                     HUBERT
                              (yelling into their 
                              teeth--in violent 
                              indignation)
                         Resign! Resign! Who found this 
                         magnificent young American? Who went 
                         down alone--in the dead of night--
                         and sought out this Lincoln--this--
                         Resign! Why, I've just begun! I'll 
                         find *more* Jefferson Smiths! I'll 
                         clean out of our glorious state every 
                         *vestige* of James Taylor--I'll--

               Now we are in a STREET, in daylight, with the BOY RANGER 
               BAND marching--playing a martial air--confetti falling on 
               them. JEFFERSON AND SAUNDERS are in the back of an open car--
               band--cheers--confetti! They are both rather dazed. A huge 
               placard, carried by a Boy Ranger, reads:

                                 JEFFERSON TO THE SENATE

                                        FOR LIFE!

               There is a BAND, and there is much cheering. Then the GOVERNOR 
               AND MRS. HOPPER are seen in the back of an open car. (Band 
               and cheers and confetti.) Happy is bowing to left and right--
               all smiles. He pauses to say:

                                     HUBERT
                         Emma--it's the White House--no less!

               JEFFERSON AND SAUNDERS are in the open car; Jeff looks off, 
               and is suddenly at attention.

               In a GROUP ON THE SIDEWALK, Joseph Paine is watching the 
               parade. Suddenly Jeff leaps out of the car and heads for the 
               curb. Saunders tries to stop him. JEFF is pushing through 
               the crowd--and grabbing for PAINE, who has fearfully started 
               to move off.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Please, sir!--come with me!

                                     PAINE
                         No, Jeff--please--!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         I say it's *your* parade, sir! You've 
                         *got* to come!

               He pulls Paine with him--back toward the automobile. The 
               people mill around them.

               The scene dissolves to the SMITH LIVING ROOM, as Jeff and 
               Saunders and Paine enter to Ma, who is waiting. (Outside we 
               still hear the band and cheers.)

                                     MA
                              (kissing Jeff's cheek)
                         Hello, Jefferson.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Hello, Ma.
                              (Indicating Saunders)
                         Clarissa, Ma. She'll be stayin' a 
                         while--

                                     MA
                              (takes Saunders' hands)
                         Fine--

                                     JEFFERSON
                         And Senator Paine too, Ma--we'd like 
                         to have him--

                                     MA
                              (warmly)
                         Certainly would, Joseph.

                                     JEFFERSON
                         How's Amos, Ma?

                                     MA
                         Just fine.

                                     JEFFERSON
                              (taking Saunders' 
                              hand)
                         We'd better see.

                                     SAUNDERS
                         Jeff--wait--they want you to speak!

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Not *me*! Joseph Paine is the man 
                         they ought to be listening to! Come 
                         on!

               He drags her off toward pet shop--Paine calling after him, 
               protesting.

               And in the PET SHOP: Saunders and Jeff are seen entering. On 
               seeing Jeff, the animals go berserk. And in a comparative 
               lull Jeff says to them:

                                     JEFFERSON
                         Meet Clarissa, fellas.

               And the scene fades out.

                                         THE END
