               EXT. A NATIVE VILLAGE IN A CLEARING BETWEEN THE JUNGLE AND 
               THE RIVER. LATE MORNING

               LONG SHOT -- A CHAPEL

               Intense light and heat, a stifling silence. Then the SOUND 
               of a reedy organ, of two voices which make the words distinct, 
               and of miscellaneous shy, muffled, dragging voices, beginning 
               a hymn:

                                     VOICES
                              (singing)
                         "Guide me O Thou Great Jehovah..."

               INT. CHAPEL -- LONG SHOT -- THE LENGTH OF THE BLEAK CHAPEL 
               PAST THE CONGREGATION, ON BROTHER, AT THE LECTERN, AND ROSE, 
               AT THE ORGAN

               BROTHER, a missionary, faces CAMERA near center; ROSE, his 
               sister, is at side, her face averted. Everybody is singing.

               "Pilgrim through this barren land..."

               MEDIUM SHOT -- BROTHER:

               middle-aged, rock-featured, bald, sweating painfully, very 
               much in earnest. He is very watchful of his flock. He sings 
               as loud as he can, rather nasally, and tries to drive the 
               meaning of each word home as if it were a nail. He is beating 
               with his hand, and trying hard to whip up the dragging tempo:

               "I am weak, but Thou art mighty..."

               CLOSER SHOT -- ROSE

               early thirties, tight-featured and tight-haired, very hot 
               but sweating less than Brother.

               She is pumping the pedals vigorously, spreading with her 
               knees the wings of wood which control the loudness, utilizing 
               various stops for expressiveness of special phrases, and 
               rather desperately studying the open hymnal, just managing 
               to play the right notes -- a very busy woman. She, too, is 
               singing her best and loudest, an innocent, arid, reedy 
               soprano; and she, too, is very attentive to the meanings of 
               words:

               "Hold me with Thy powerful hand."

               INSERT -- HALF-WAY THROUGH THE FOREGOING LINE, AN EXOTIC AND 
               HORRIBLE CENTIPEDE-LIKE CREATURE SLITHERS INTO VIEW BETWEEN 
               TWO OF THE ORGAN KEYS. WITHOUT INTERRUPTING HER PLAYING, AS 
               METHODICALLY AS SHE WOULD PULL OUT A NEW STOP, ROSE SWIPES 
               IT AWAY.

               ROSE -- AS BEFORE --

               completes "Thy Powerful Hand"; o.s. Voices of singers. 
               Unperturbed, Rose finishes her casual disposal of the bug 
               and pulls out a new stop.

               MISCELLANEOUS SHOTS --

               Through rest of hymn, SHOOT and CUT against its lines for 
               meaning, irony and pathos, roughly as follows:

               FULL VIEW of congregation past Brother and Rose. They are 
               all Negroes and nearly all are dressed in glaring white -- 
               the women in garments like camisoles, the men in pants which 
               reach about to their shins: splayed, bare feet. Some of the 
               faces bear the marks of heavy savage ornaments which have 
               been removed, or of tatooing and scarring rituals which have 
               been outlived -- torn nostrils, lips and ear lobes, a neck 
               curiously thin and weak from the enormously heavy metal bands 
               which used to surround it. Some of the children are naked or 
               near-naked. Nearly everybody dutifully shares open hymnals, 
               but it is obvious that few, if any, can read. The singing of 
               most of them is weirdly shy and inchoate -- a little like 
               that of a neighborhood audience when a group "sing" is imposed 
               upon them. But on certain high phrases a glad, rich, wet 
               soprano lifts out large and happy, very child-like; and a 
               big male voice bleats forth joyous, jazz-like improvements 
               on the tune, a little off-key. There are very few men present.

               We detail or bring into salience, bare feet slapping time 
               and an anklet shimmying; a very earnest young married couple 
               with the wedding ring prominent and an impressive phalanx of 
               children in tow; the owner of the happy soprano, a sweet, 
               contented, pre-moral face; the owner of the big male voice; 
               the inevitable rather effeminate man in every congregation 
               who loves religion because he loves Beauty. He is immensely 
               pleased that he knows all the words (the others just dab at 
               them): he sings them without any knowledge of their meaning: 
               they sound Hawaiian. Also, we SPOT a tremendously old, 
               wrinkled, bent-over woman, dressed in white like a good 
               Christian, but with a bone stuck through the septum of her 
               nose. She croaks, toothless, bleary-eyed.

               These things must be disposed of by late in the first stanza, 
               which continues:

               "Open now the crystal fountain Whence the living waters flow, 
               Let the fiery, cloudy pillar Lead me all my journey through."

               We close on the old dame with the bone singing --

               "...my journey through." o.s., on "...fiery, cloudy pillar", 
               a queer SOUND, steadily louder: the absurdly flatulent, 
               yammering syncopation of a rachitic steam motor. Eyes begin 
               to wander from hymnals: CUT IN Brother frowning and singing 
               harder trying to impose order; attention to the hymn begins 
               to fall apart a little; FOLLOW the white, veering eyes to 
               FRAME, through the open window.

               LONG SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               whose WHISTLE lets out a steamy whinny, then REPEATS it, 
               with great self-satisfaction. She is squat, flat-bottomed -- 
               thirty feet long. A tattered awning roofs in six feet of her 
               stern. Amidships stand her boiler and engine. A stumpy funnel 
               reaches up a little higher than the awning.

               ON SECOND WHINNY,

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- ON HIS BOAT

               He is in worn, rather befouled white clothes. He is barefooted 
               and his feet are cocked up and he is sitting on his shoulder 
               blades, smoking a bad cigar. He wears a ratty boater, 
               slantwise, against the sunlight. He is attended by two young 
               Negroes so tall, thin and gracile they suggest black macaroni. 
               One is proudly and busily puttering at the engine, which 
               requires a lot of attention: the other is fanning ALLNUTT, 
               who is feeling just fine. Allnutt speaks to the fanner in 
               Swahili. The young man without breaking the rhythm of his 
               fanning, licks out one long, boneless arm and alters the 
               lashed tiller; the Queen begins to swerve toward shore. o.s., 
               the hymn continues, all but drowned by motor noise.

               LONG SHOT -- INT. CHAPEL

               Rose pulls out all the stops, spreads her knees, and pumps 
               like mad in her effort to drown out the ENGINE SOUND. Brother 
               sweats and sings even harder, scowling, shaking his head. 
               The singing is fraying out half to hell; the congregation is 
               a solid black wall of wandering eyes; a few pious converts 
               frown or nudge at the less pious; a little group is coalescing 
               toward the window.

               The hymn, meanwhile, continues:

               "Feed me with the heavenly manna in this barren wilderness, 
               Be my sword, my shield, my banner, be the Lord my 
               righteousness."

               Rose's sense of artistic propriety is too much for her. To 
               keep things going, she ought to play loud, but on the next 
               line --

               "When I tread the verge of Jordan..." she shuts down to the 
               vox humana and the tremolo and maintains that through --

               "Bid my anxious fears subside."

               On this line, Allnutt appears and lounges against the front 
               door frame still drawing on his cigar. Rose lets everything 
               rip fortissimo on the closing lines:

               "Death of death, and hell's destruction land me safe on 
               Canaan's side."

               By the time of "hell's destruction," Allnutt becomes aware 
               that a lighted cigar in church is bad manners, and, nodding 
               casual apology to Brother, tosses it away onto the packed 
               dirt, out of our sight. Instantly there is a hell of a 
               hullaballoo o.s., all in gibberish, against which the closing 
               words of the hymn compete stridently.

               The less self-controlled of the flock are no longer singing, 
               and are craning their necks and rolling their eyes, but with 
               just enough Sunday-Schoolish discipline to stay in their 
               places. The more pious, with effort, keep their eyes where 
               they belong and SING all the harder. IN QUICK SHOTS, Brother 
               and Rose redouble their efforts. There is a final long-drawn 
               "Aaaa-men," and it is clear this is the closing hymn of the 
               service. Brother closes his book and picks up his service-
               book; Rose shuts and locks the box-organ and puts the key 
               (which is on two shoestrings) around her neck. Brother strides 
               with decorous alacrity down the middle aisle. Immediately 
               following him, the natives hurry from their benches.

               SHOOTING PAST ALLNUTT -- THROUGH DOOR

               on the cause of the hullaballoo -- a squabbling football 
               scrimmage of virtually nude male heathens, battling for the 
               cigar butt. In b.g., if permissible, a couple of equally 
               nude women; a thin, pot-bellied little boy dashing happily 
               toward the fight. Brother and the eager heads of white-clad 
               Christians come into the SHOT, BACK TO CAMERA, watching. One 
               of the heathen fights his way up from the heap with a yowl 
               of supremacy, filed teeth in a great grin, prancing and 
               holding high above them all the frantically busted cigar of 
               vaudeville; others leap after it.

               REVERSE ANGLE

               Allnutt, seeing the wrecked cigar, looks kind of bleak. As 
               Brother comes out, he meets his annoyed eye with mingled 
               reproach, apology and indifference.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (to Brother)
                         Hello, Reverend.

                                     BROTHER
                         Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Here's your mail. Sorry I'm late, 
                         but one thing and another kept me in 
                         Limbasi. You know how it is, Reverend.
                              (he winks)
                         Or maybe you don't.

               Brother clears his throat.

                                     ALLNUT
                         They gave me a real going over when 
                         I got to the mine. They called me 
                         all the names they could think of -- 
                         in Belgian, but I don't mind so much 
                         bein' cursed in a foreign language, 
                         so I just took it with a smile. They 
                         wouldn't fire me, I was sure of that. 
                         There ain't nobody in Central Africa 
                         but yours truly knows how to get up 
                         a head of steam on The African Queen. 
                         It may sound like bragging, Reverend, 
                         but I'm mighty close to being in-di-
                         spensable. Seein's how them Belgians 
                         is too damn cheap to buy 'er a new 
                         engine.

               Rose joins them at the door.

                                     ROSE
                              (indifferently)
                         Good morning, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Mornin', Miss.

               Rose's prayer book is clamped under her sharp elbow. Her 
               walking is used to country, yet tight and spinsterish.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT, BROTHER AND ROSE

               For a moment Allnutt looks at Rose with utter casualness and 
               indifference; his eyes leave her even before Brother speaks. 
               Brother is looking through the mail. Past them, the liberated 
               Christians walk into the sunshine.

                                     BROTHER
                         Ah, splendid, At last they've come.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Huh?

                                     BROTHER
                         My marrow seed.

               Behind these lines, the TINY OLD WOMAN with the nose-bone 
               makes herself prominent; she's waiting to speak to Brother, 
               almost plucking his sleeve.

                                     BROTHER
                              (to Allnutt)
                         Yes.
                              (to Grandma)
                         Yes?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                              (in snaggle-toothed, 
                              adoring enthusiasm)
                         Oh Mistah Sayuh, I does like how you 
                         preach!

                                     BROTHER
                         'k you?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         All dat hell-fish!

               Brother nods and smiles uneasily.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         De way yo' neck swell up.

                                     BROTHER
                              (in dismissal)
                         Thank you, thank you.
                              (to Allnutt, without 
                              enthusiasm)
                         You'll stop for tea, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Don't care if I do.

               They start walking TOWARDS AND PAST CAMERA.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INT. DINING ROOM. MED. SHOT -- RIGIDLY SYMMETRICAL, ACROSS 
               DINING ROOM TABLE

               Rose at dead center, Brother at her left, in profile, Allnutt 
               at her right, opposite Brother, in profile. The room is so 
               shaded against heat it is gloomy. The silence, gloom and 
               heat are stifling. Rose is pouring the second of three cups 
               of tea; she pours the third. Brother is deep in the news of 
               a Mission paper. Allnutt sits oppressed by the silence, like 
               a child on his good behavior. A long silence while Rose 
               leisurely pours.

                                     ROSE
                         You take sugar, Mr. Allnutt, I seem 
                         to remember.

                                     ALLNUT
                         That's right, Miss. Couple 
                         o'spoonfuls.

               She doles them into his cup.

                                     ROSE
                         And cream.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Right.

               Rose passes him his tea.

                                     ROSE
                         Bread and butter?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (taking some)
                         'oh obliged.

               He picks up his cup an inch to drink and puts it down again. 
               Nobody else is served yet. Rose fixes Brother's tea and plants 
               it beside him. She puts a slice of bread and butter on his 
               plate.

                                     BROTHER
                              (reading)
                         'k you?

               Rose finishes fixing her own tea, and helps herself to bread-
               and-butter. She lifts her cup, not quite crooking her pinkie, 
               and sips. Allnutt still doesn't move; he is waiting for 
               Brother. Brother finishes and turns his page, and, without 
               shifting his eyes, finds his tea with a blind hand and blindly 
               drinks it and sets down the cup again. Allnutt, licensed, 
               takes a big bite of bread-and-butter and picks up his cup 
               and washes it down. By Rose's covered reaction, it is clear 
               that she has been taught never, never to do this, but that 
               she expects no better of such as Allnutt. Allnutt sighs wetly 
               and contentedly. This, too, is bad manners to Rose, but she 
               takes it in her stride.

               They go on soberly eating bread-and-butter and drinking tea. 
               The only SOUNDS are those of china, sipping, chewing and 
               swallowing. Nobody looks at anyone else. Brother and Rose 
               are wholly, stiffly reposeful; they are used to this. Allnutt 
               begins to get a little squirmy, like a child in church. The 
               silence makes him visibly uneasy, but he tries not to show 
               his uneasiness.

               All of a sudden, out of the silence, there is a SOUND like a 
               mandolin string being plucked. At first the sound is 
               unidentifiable, though instantly all three glance sharply 
               up, each at the other two, then away; in the next instant 
               they recognize what it is and each glances sharply, 
               incredulously, at the other two -- and then again, quickly 
               away; then Brother and Rose glance with full recognition at 
               Allnutt, at the instant that he knows the belly-growl is 
               his. At the moment of recognition, he glances down at his 
               middle with a look of embarrassed reproach. He glances up 
               quickly and slyly -- hopeful they've missed it -- to find 
               the eyes of both still fixed on him. The instant their eyes 
               meet they bounce apart like billiard balls, and fix on the 
               first neutral object they happen to hit. Then Allnutt looks 
               at them again: neither will look at him.

               All three lift their cups at the same moment, for a covering, 
               disembarrassing drink of tea. Rose and Allnutt simultaneously 
               recognize what they are doing (Brother is pretending to read, 
               misses it, and goes ahead and drinks his), and both, at the 
               same moment, lower their cups to saucers with an almost 
               simultaneous clink. Both look away from each other. Brother 
               clears his throat rather loudly and turns a page. Rose and 
               Allnutt reach for their cups; Brother beats them to it. When 
               Brother has again put down his cup, Rose -- the tail of her 
               eye on Allnutt -- picks up her cup and drinks, her eyes 
               carefully empty above the cup. Allnutt has his cup again on 
               the way to his mouth when his insides give out with a growl 
               so long-drawn and terrible that Rose first flinches, then 
               makes a noise across it with her spoon, stirring her tea. 
               Brother tightens up like a fist, his first reflex being that 
               this loud one is a calculated piece of effrontery. Allnutt 
               just endures it, with a look of suffering stoicism. When it 
               is over there is a tense silence. Allnutt slowly, slyly looks 
               up at Brother; he is stone. He looks to Rose; she is gazing 
               far off into space. Allnutt is quite embarrassed, and knows 
               they are. He does his best to relieve his own embarrassment 
               and theirs.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (in a friendly, yet 
                              detached tone)
                         Just listen to that stomick of mine.

               There is a silence. By their almost invisible reaction, it 
               is clear that to just listen to that stomick of his, is the 
               last thing they want to do. Allnutt is a bit chilled by the 
               silence, but he tries again.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Way it sounds, you'd think I'd got 
                         an 'eye-ener inside me.

               A silence.

               Rose looks at Allnutt; their eyes meet; he attempts a friendly 
               smile. Her face goes stony with embarrassment and she looks 
               quickly away. So does he.

                                     ROSE
                              (as soon as she can 
                              manage it)
                         Do have another cup of tea, Mr. 
                         Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Thanks, Miss, don't mind if I do.

               He passes his cup, while she pours. There is a third growling; 
               not so bad. Allnutt says nothing. Then, after a pause:

                                     ALLNUT
                         Scuse me.

               Rose looks stone deaf. She hands him his cup.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Much obliged, Miss.

               He drinks some tea.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Queer thing, ain't it.
                              (a silence)
                         Wot I mean, wot d'you spose it is, 
                         makes a man's stomick carry on like 
                         that?

                                     ROSE
                         Bread and butter, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Thanks, Miss.

               He takes some and eats. After a little chewing, his jaws 
               slow; he is expecting another growl and listens intently; so 
               does Rose; none comes, After a little, Allnutt relaxes and 
               Rose relaxes at least to a state of armed truce. They are 
               both munching methodically, eyes out of focus, when Brother 
               takes a curiously official-mannered gulp of tea, sets down 
               his cup, and breaks the silence.

                                     BROTHER
                         Herbie Morton's a bishop.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (thinking the remark 
                              is addressed to him)
                         Huh?

                                     ROSE
                         Who's that, dear?

               Allnutt is pretty embarrassed to have said "huh."

                                     BROTHER
                         Surely you remember Herbie Morton.
                              (Rose looks doubtful)
                         Blond, ruddy-complected chap, a bit 
                         younger than me. He sang a solo at 
                         the graduation exercises. "Holy, 
                         Holy", I believe.

                                     ROSE
                              (dubiously)
                         I think I remember. It was so long 
                         ago.

                                     BROTHER
                         Well, he's a bishop now.

                                     ROSE
                         Splendid.

                                     BROTHER
                         I'd say Herbie was a bit younger 
                         than I -- four or five years.
                              (Rose pours more tea 
                              into his cup)
                         Surprising in a way. I mean -- well, 
                         there was nothing outstanding about 
                         him. He was no great shakes as a 
                         student and he didn't have any more 
                         than his share of the social graces.
                              (a pause; he drinks 
                              then eats bread and 
                              butter, but with 
                              rather less relish 
                              than before)
                         No doubt one does get ahead quicker 
                         at home than in a foreign field... 
                         And then, of course, he did marry 
                         well.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh!

                                     BROTHER
                         That manufacturer's widow. What was 
                         his name? Briggs -- Griggs -- Briggs -- 
                         yes, Alfred Briggs. Soap flakes, I 
                         think. Yes, Mrs. Alfred Briggs.
                              (pause)
                         Not to take anything away from Herbie.
                              (pause)
                         I am delighted for him.

                                     ROSE
                         Of course.

                                     BROTHER
                         It was "Holy, Holy."

                                     ROSE
                              (pause)
                         Yes.

               A silence. Brother isn't even looking at his paper. Allnutt's 
               stomach talks gently. They all accept it stoically.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (after quite a silence)
                         There ain't a thing I can do about 
                         it.

               A silence.

                                     ROSE
                         More tea, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         No, Miss, I reckon not. About time I 
                         shoved off, if I'm gonna get back to 
                         the mine by tomorra night.

                                     ROSE
                              (insincerely)
                         Don't hurry, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     BROTHER
                              (sure he is safe)
                         Stay for dinner.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (shaking his head)
                         Thanks all the same.

               Brother pushes back his chair. Allnutt pushes back his chair 
               and gets up. Rose pats her lips with her handkerchief, pushes 
               back her chair, and gets up.

                                     BROTHER
                         Mr. Allnutt brought the marrow seed 
                         at last.

                                     ROSE
                         Splendid.

                                     BROTHER
                         I must say, though, they were forever 
                         getting here.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Lucky they come through now, cause 
                         it don't look like they'll be no 
                         more mail for a while.

                                     BROTHER
                         Why not?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Reckon the Germans'll hold it up.

                                     BROTHER
                              (irate -- we sense a 
                              background of 
                              unpleasant relations 
                              with the Germans)

                                     ALLNUT
                         Cause it looks like there's a war 
                         on.

                                     BROTHER
                         No. Really? Where, Mr. Allnutt?

                         Europe.

                                     BROTHER
                              (with the patronizing 
                              concern of one who 
                              hears of another 
                              Balkan brawl)
                         Indeed! Between whom?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh, Germany, England, the whole --

                         You mm -- you really mean war?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Wot they tell me. Germans claim the 
                         British started it. British claim it 
                         was the Germans. In any case, it's 
                         war.

                                     ROSE
                              (with great intensity)
                         But what's happened! What do you 
                         know about it!

                                     BROTHER
                              (like a whip)
                         Rose!
                              (she shuts up fast)
                         Exactly, Mr. Allnutt, what has 
                         happened?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, now, that's about all I can 
                         remember. Oh yes -- France is in it, 
                         too. She's with us, I fink. A lot 'o 
                         them little countries are in it too -- 
                         Austria-Hungary, Spain, Belgium -- I 
                         forget 'oo's with 'oom.

               A pause.

                                     BROTHER
                              (quiet desperation)
                         And that is all you can tell us?

                                     ALLNUT
                         All I know. -- I'll try to pick up 
                         some more, next trip to Limbasi.

                                     BROTHER
                         I wonder to what extent we here shall 
                         be affected.

                                     ALLNUT
                         None, I shouldn't think.

                                     BROTHER
                         This is German territory.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Why would they want to bother a poor 
                         devil of a missionary and his maiden 
                         sister? -- beggin' your pardons.

                                     BROTHER
                         We are enemy aliens.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Wot's the difference -- in this God-
                         forsaken place?

                                     ROSE
                              (bridling)
                         God has not forgotten this place, 
                         Mr. Allnutt -- as my brother's 
                         presence here bears witness.

                                     ALLNUT
                         No offence, Miss.

               Another puzzled pause.

                                     BROTHER
                         Really war.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Looks like it... Well, I better shove 
                         off now. Many thanks for the tea.

               He opens the door and goes through it.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT -- GROUP

               as Brother and Rose come through after him.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, take care of yerselves.
                              (he goes down the 
                              steps)
                         See ya next month.

                                     BROTHER
                         Goodbye. And thank you.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (at bottom of steps)
                         'Bye, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                         Goodbye, Mr. Allnutt.

               LONG SHOT -- PAST THEM

               CAMERA watches them watch him as he shambles towards his 
               boat. He soon lights a stogie; his relief in smoking and in 
               being free of them is eloquent in his back. His boys jump to 
               action; curious villagers make way for him; the engine is 
               going by the time he gets there. The boat backs out and sets 
               its course upstream; Allnutt turns and lifts a hand. Brother 
               lifts a hand; Rose doesn't. The boat soon goes out of sight 
               beyond trees.

               OVER the above, back-to-CAMERA, or quarter-profiled from the 
               rear as they idly watch his departure, Rose and Brother talk 
               quietly as follows:

                                     ROSE
                         Shouldn't we perhaps call him back? 
                         Get to Limbasi while we can?

                                     BROTHER
                              (with unction, yet 
                              with dignity)
                         The good shepherd does not forsake 
                         his flock when wolves prowl.
                              (a pause)
                         Besides, I think Allnutt is very 
                         probably right... I can't imagine 
                         any reason why the Germans should 
                         trouble us.

                                     ROSE
                         No, I suppose not.

               By now, the boat is pulling out; Brother and Allnutt exchange 
               their not very friendly waves. Rose looks idly after Allnutt, 
               in Sunday boredom. Nothing is said for a few seconds after 
               the boat vanishes; the SOUND of the engine dwindles.

                                     BROTHER
                              (awed, and moved)
                         War. England. Just think!

               As he speaks, CAMERA STARTS a coldly SLOW PAN, past the 
               chapel, and square onto the jungle, so altering its position 
               behind Brother and Rose that they are held in -- l.s. (where 
               before they were in r.s.).

               (N.B.: BY MID-PAN the ENGINE SOUND dies.)

               An almost nude native explodes from the wall of jungle, 
               running as fast as he can, bellowing breathlessly in Swahili 
               and English. Until they hear his bellowing, Brother's and 
               Rose's heads are still ANGLED AWAY from jungle -- not towards 
               river still, but idle and unfocused. With the first sound of 
               his voice, their heads turn sharply, with weary impatience, 
               not alarm, towards the sound.

               The native does not pause in the village, though he shouts 
               vague things in Swahili as he runs, setting up a kind of 
               helpless agitation among the villagers; in b.g. we see still 
               more of them coming with lazy interest out of their huts, 
               while the native tears towards the bungalow bellowing, 
               breathlessly.

                                     NATIVE
                         Mistah Sayuh! Mistah Sayuh!

               MEDIUM CLOSEUP -- ROSE AND BROTHER (FROM RUNNER'S ANGLE)

               favoring Brother.

                                     NATIVE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Mistah! Oh Mistah Sayuh!

               The eyes of Brother and Rose abruptly lift beyond the runner 
               and come into focus as hard as hawks; almost instantly, their 
               faces become terrible with recognition, despair, and courage -- 
               and, for the moment with uncertainty, still, whether such 
               emotions are needed.

               REVERSE SHOT -- (FROM THEIR ANGLE AND DISTANCE) -- GERMAN 
               TROOPS

               emerge from the somber wall of the jungle, tiny against the 
               wall, but looking very efficacious and professional in their 
               tropical uniforms. Instantly they form ranks before an officer 
               who barks an order in German, just audible to us. The natives 
               are somewhat scared and awed, but mainly immobilized with 
               scare, awe, and curiosity. Upon the order, the Germans 
               promptly break ranks and start swiftly and effectively about 
               their business. One group starts rounding up the natives. 
               Another starts collecting live-stock, usable food and 
               supplies. Another covers operations with rifles. Two men 
               light torches and start setting fire to straw huts. One man 
               stands by the officer.

                                     BROTHER'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; as soon as it 
                              becomes clear what 
                              the Germans are up 
                              to, his voice is 
                              quiet but harsh)
                         Rose -- go indoors and stay there.

               o.s., the SOUND of their feet on the front steps. They come 
               swiftly into the SHOT BELOW the CAMERA and walk fast, Rose 
               trailing, towards the officer. After only a few steps Brother 
               begins to trot, ungainly; Rose, still more ungainly, in her 
               narrow skirt, trots too.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE OFFICER --

               a tired, rather heavy, neutral, thoroughly unmemorable face. 
               He is not as tall as Brother, to whom he is giving the once-
               over. His look is neither brutal nor humane: just experienced. 
               It seems to say, roughly and humorously: "Well, well, what 
               have I got to deal with here?" His guardian soldier steps 
               quickly to one side and forward; a nonentity with a gun.

               LESS CLOSE SHOT -- BROTHER -- (ROSE IN B.G.)

                                     BROTHER
                              (boiling mad, the 
                              innocent courage of 
                              a lion)
                         What is the meaning of this outrage!

               OFFICER --

               centered, but a little less close than before; his guard in 
               extreme r.s.

                                     OFFICER
                              (calmly, in German)
                         Speak German, please; I speak no 
                         English.

               CLOSER SHOT -- BROTHER

               the crest of a wave of righteous fury mounting just before 
               breaking; toppling forward; the terrifying face of a man 
               almost ready to murder out of a sense of being right.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE FOUR OF THEM --

               as close as the CAMERA can frame all four; as, simultaneously, 
               Brother lunges forward at the officer, Rose lunges forward 
               to prevent Brother; the officer steps neatly backward and 
               sidewise, and his guardian steps forward briskly and, sharply 
               but just hard enough to be effective, and with an ugly SOUND 
               of impact, strikes Brother on the left joint of the jaw with 
               his rifle butt. Brother goes heavily to the ground with a 
               groaning gasp.

                                     BROTHER
                              (rage, shock, 
                              astonishment)
                         No!

                                     ROSE
                              (at same instant, 
                              squatting beside 
                              him, turning his 
                              head; she is beside 
                              herself)
                         Judkins!

               CLOSE UP -- BROTHER -- (SHOOTING DOWN PAST ROSE) as she turns 
               his head.

                                     BROTHER
                              (semi-conscious; his 
                              jaw not broken but 
                              bleeding and already 
                              swelling)
                         No. No.

                                     ROSE
                              (across his words)
                         Oh, Judkins. Brother dear. Come, 
                         dear. Come, Brother.

               She helps him to his feet; past them, the officer and his 
               guard walk briskly, aloofly away, and past the whole business, 
               as Brother and Rose get up and the CAMERA LIFTS to normal 
               eye level with them, a much later stage of the destruction 
               of the village is visible in b.g. and is implied o.s. by 
               Brother's eyes.

               Brother's eyes, scorched-looking, appalled, all but demented, 
               flick from horror to horror; he is watching the annihilation 
               of his life's work and, to his mind, the annihilation of 
               Christian and potential Christian souls; his head quavers in 
               the negative gesture like that of a paretic; his mouth, always 
               hard up to this moment, trembles now and looks curiously 
               large and sensual.

                                     BROTHER
                         No! No, Lord! O no! O no! Lord! No! 
                         O no!

               Rose is in the SHOT with him; shorter and less favored than 
               he is. Her eyes are constantly upon his face. Tears come out 
               of her eyes, but she is doing no vocal crying. She is watching 
               his heart break and, essentially, she is watching him die, 
               and knows it.

                                                                 SLOW FADE:

               FADE IN:

               LONG SHOT -- SAME AS THAT WHICH OPENS THE PICTURE --

               the hottest part of the day -- most smashing sunlight 
               possible.

               There is no village now -- only the round scorched marks 
               where the huts stood; a sketch of debris.

               At some distance from the bungalow, and in the middle of a 
               lot of gaping space, Brother is hoeing in his vegetable 
               garden. He is terribly small in the enormous barrenness and 
               light. He hoes long enough to convey great loneliness and a 
               kind of blind perseverance, then straightens and looks rather 
               vaguely around him, mopping his face and bald head with a 
               handkerchief. Then, with an abrupt look of purpose, he starts 
               walking, letting the hoe fall where it happens to. He walks 
               towards the bungalow, across the bare ground, not very fast 
               or very steadily, but purposefully. The sunlight makes a 
               near-halation on his bare, bald head. The walk takes him 
               long enough to infer utter loneliness and the destruction of 
               any human sense of time. He starts up the front steps.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE IN THE PARLOR

               She hears him coming up the steps o.s. She continues mending 
               his nightshirt. On SOUND of him coming through front door, 
               she glances up again and her face becomes curious, then 
               concerned.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- BROTHER -- (FROM HER VIEWPOINT)

               as he advances into room. He is dressed in his Sunday best, 
               immaculate except for sweat-and-dust of immediate garden 
               work. His face is carefully shaven, but it has thinned and 
               he is very pale. The wounded jaw is not bandaged and is 
               virtually healed; stubble around it. There is a streak of 
               garden dust across the temple and up onto the bald head. He 
               is looking hard at Rose, but his eyes can't keep in focus.

                                     BROTHER
                              (sweat pouring from 
                              him, teeth rattling)
                         Why aren't you dressed, Rose? It's 
                         time for Service.

               SIDE ANGLE SHOT -- ROSE

               gets up, deep concern on her face, comes quickly to him, 
               bringing both into SHOT, and lays a hand against his forehead. 
               Her reaction infers that Brother has a terribly high fever.

                                     ROSE
                         You must wear your hat!

                                     BROTHER
                              (teeth chattering)
                         Time, this minute!

               Rose starts to lead and support his obstinacy, CAMERA WITH 
               THEM, towards his bedroom door.

                                     ROSE
                         You must lie down a bit. You're not 
                         at all well.

                                     BROTHER
                              (resisting feebly but 
                              coming along, shakily)
                         But it's time. It's time.

                                     ROSE
                         You're not well enough. Lie down a 
                         bit, dear.

                                     BROTHER
                         Perhaps I should. I feel rather odd.

                                     ROSE
                         I'll help you off with your things.

                                     BROTHER
                              (in a suddenly normal 
                              and shriveling voice; 
                              quietly)
                         Rose.

               She opens his door for him; he starts through.

                                     BROTHER
                              (as he turns to shut 
                              his door)
                         'k you?

               He shuts the door in her face.

               For a moment she stands outside the door as if paralyzed. 
               Then she starts somewhere fast.

               CLOSE UP -- THEIR FORLORNLY POPULATED BOOKSHELF.

               Rose hurries into the SHOT and takes down a large obsolescent-
               looking Home-Medical Compodium.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               SHOOTING LOW across the bleak dining room table as she hustles 
               the big book to it and opens it. She is standing. She is 
               still in a painful rush through the index when o.s. there is 
               the NOISE of a catastrophic fall.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE (BACK TO CAMERA)

               at Brother's door. By reflex, she hesitates and raps timidly. 
               Instantly realizing the idiocy of this, she bursts in.

               REVERSE ANGLE SHOT -- ROSE

               inside Brother's bedroom, SHOOTING FROM LOW as she enters 
               and stands a moment transfixed by what she sees, her face 
               suddenly rigid and masklike with horror and pity.

               CLOSE SHOT -- DOWN -- BROTHER (FROM ROSE'S VIEWPOINT)

               He is piteous, absurd and ugly; sprawled out on the floor as 
               ill-shaped as a wounded bat, with his nightshirt partly on, 
               shrouding his head, and his trousers half off, trammeling 
               knees which are grotesquely angled. Between lowered pants 
               and hiked-up nightshirt, a sad, humiliating expanse of long 
               white drawers in this furnace weather. His feet are fouled-
               up in his suspenders. The SHOT is to be both preposterous 
               and shocking.

               CLOSE UP SHOT -- ROSE

               past Brother from floor.

                                     ROSE
                              (almost whispering)
                         Brother! Brother dear!

               She rushes stooping towards him. CAMERA MOVES into CLOSE UP, 
               as she lifts his heavy head clearly into the SHOT and gets 
               it unveiled from the nightshirt. The big face looks ruined, 
               disgraced, dead, but a low mumbling sighing comes from him. 
               He is far gone.

               She is about to try to lift him towards his bed when he begins 
               to walk; she waits and listens.

                                     BROTHER
                              (eyes shut; a faint, 
                              delirious voice)
                         Smite them, Lord! Smite the 
                         Amalekites, hip and thigh!

                                     ROSE
                              (whispering -- almost 
                              by reflex)
                         Amen.
                              (with a long a)

                                     BROTHER
                         So cold and so foggy. My eyes are so 
                         tired. Where is Rose? Rose, are you 
                         down there in the shop? Rose, bring 
                         me a cup of hot tea.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm here with you, Brother dear. 
                         Right here beside you.

                                     BROTHER
                         I try to study -- so hard. I haven't 
                         had the start some have: 'Ebrew; 
                         Greek -- no -- facility. If only 
                         there were more time. Well, if I 
                         can't pass the examinations, I can 
                         volunteer. I can be a missionary. 
                         Rose, too. Not comely among maidens, 
                         but she can become a servant in the 
                         house of the Lord. Yes, even for 
                         such as she, God finds a goodly use.

               There is deep pain on Rose's face. She almost wants to say 
               something, but knows the senselessness of it. She just keeps 
               looking at him and listening.

                                     BROTHER
                              (with calm, resolve, 
                              acceptance)
                         I'm going to put my books away, Rose. 
                         I'm not going to study any more. If 
                         I don't pass, it only means that God 
                         has other work for me. Thy will be 
                         done.
                              (in a different voice, 
                              secret, piteous, 
                              impassioned)
                         But, Lord, if it be Thy Will, O let 
                         me distinguish myself and give me a 
                         call here in England, right here at 
                         home, Lord. Mother will be so proud, 
                         Lord. Abash and put to shame all 
                         them that revile me and persecute me 
                         for Thy Name's sake.
                              (whispering; pleading)
                         Lord, I have tried so hard.

               He is silent; she is motionless. Slowly LIFT CAMERA, losing 
               Brother, CENTERING ROSE IN CLOSE UP.

                                                                 SLOW FADE:

               FADE IN:

               FULL SHOT -- MUDDY WATER -- MORNING

               The screen is filled with a foamy, strongly sliding floor of 
               muddy water; a strong, serene freshness of water SOUND. The 
               SHOT is VERTICAL onto this water from perhaps three feet 
               above it. o.s., already loud, and loudening, the NOISE of 
               the engine of The African Queen.

               LIFT CAMERA, picking up the launch unexpectedly close as, 
               slanting into broadside, she draws the letters of her name.

               THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               large across the SHOT.

               CONTINUE LIFTING; as boat passes, we see Allnutt very briefly 
               and see that he is alone.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               over SOUND of expiring engine and rattle of anchor chain, 
               reacting to his first sight of the vanished village. He looks 
               a little scared and very cautious; he has seen what was done 
               at the mine, and now even the smell of violence, or the echo 
               of its impact, makes him very uneasy. He is even dirtier and 
               more unshaven than when we first saw him and he looks 
               extremely tired.

               LONG SHOT -- THE VILLAGE

               what we see of it from his angle. Since he is lower than the 
               village, all we can see is a lot of abnormal, empty sunlight.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT (SAME AS BEFORE)

               He is wary, but knows he must investigate. He goes overside, 
               almost out of the SHOT, stepping across a stump to shore. 
               SWING WITH HIM.

               As he reaches the top of the low bank, TRUCK with him, MEDIUM 
               CLOSE, as he walks through a little of the burnt-out village. 
               Past him, the scorched circular blotches where the huts were; 
               burned and half-burned little pens and fences; ravaged 
               gardens. He is still careful and uneasy. Unaware of it, he 
               walks through this silence of devastation almost on tiptoe. 
               Now he raises his eyes towards the intact bungalow o.s., and 
               a new kind of carefulness comes into his eyes.

               STOP the TRUCKING and PAN with him as he walks past and bring 
               in the bungalow, looking cavernous, very still, and cryptic 
               or menacing in the sunlight, as he walks the last few paces 
               towards it. He hesitates a moment at the foot of the steps. 
               It obviously occurs to him that he may find corpses, or nobody 
               at all. He starts up the steps, still walking a little 
               stealthily.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               through the screen door, from inside, as he comes up the 
               quietly creaking steps, sensitive to the mood of a kind of 
               desolation different from that of the village; uneasy. He 
               crosses the porch very quietly, again hesitates, peers through 
               the gray screen door into the dark interior, and raps rather 
               timidly.

                                     ROSE
                              (o.s., a dry quiet 
                              voice with the calm 
                              of exhaustion in it)
                         Come in, Mr. Allnutt.

               Her voice startles him as much as it should ourselves. He 
               peers again, forehead wrinkled like a monkey's. He can't see 
               her. He shyly opens and comes through the door, mumbling 
               something apologetic and subversal.

               As he catches sight of her, SWING CAMERA to RIGHT, losing 
               him, and PICK ROSE UP, MEDIUM CLOSE. She is past the angle 
               of visibility from the screen door. She is in a wicker rocking 
               chair, sitting quite primly, working with those rings on 
               which embroidering is done. She glances up at him with eyes 
               like fused glass -- then quickly back to her needlework. It 
               is clear by the over-precision of her motions, and their 
               rigidity and tension, that she is under great strain, but 
               this is to be keyed low and simple.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT (FROM HER ANGLE)

               He watches her; he knows enough to keep quiet; he waits; 
               becomes aware of his muddy feet and quietly tries to clean 
               one against the calf and shin of the other leg.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE (SAME AS BEFORE)

               She does a couple more stitches, obtains sufficient control 
               of herself, and lowers the needlework into her lap.

                                     ROSE
                              (quietly, as before)
                         Thank God you've come.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT (AS BEFORE)

               Nobody has ever thanked God in connection with him before. 
               His reaction is quiet, but clearly this is a surprising and 
               novel experience. He says nothing.

                                     ROSE
                         (o.S.) Sit down, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Don't mind if I do.

               He walks into:

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               He sits on the edge of a chair and jockeys it, shyly, a little 
               nearer her.

                                     ALLNUT
                         So they got here afore I did, eh?

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, they got here. Just after you 
                         left.

                                     ALLNUT
                         No!

               She says nothing.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Couldn't a been more wrong, could I? 
                         Bout the Germans.

                                     ROSE
                              (a quieter, remote 
                              voice)
                         Burning villages.

                                     ALLNUT
                         That's to keep the natives from 
                         runnin' away. No place to come back 
                         to. Been doin' it all over, they 
                         told me up at Limbasi. The Germans 
                         are gonna train 'em into an army and 
                         try to take over the whole of Africa.

                                     ROSE
                         Poor helpless natives!

                                     ALLNUT
                         It was the same up at the mine when 
                         I got back from Limbasi. A clean 
                         sweep of everything. Just plain luck 
                         I was on the river. They could 
                         certainly use my launch and what's 
                         in 'er, too. Blastin' gelatine, Miss. 
                         Eight boxes of it. An' a lot of canned 
                         grub. An' cylinders of oxygen an' 
                         hydrogen for that weldin' job on the 
                         crusher. Lots o' stuff.

                                     ROSE
                              (same dead voice)
                         Oh, trust them.

                                     ALLNUT
                         But as it 'appens, I got the stuff -- 
                         an' the launch. Only I've got no 
                         crew, an' she ain't an easy boat to 
                         run single-'anded. Cause them two 
                         boys o' mine just skipped in the 
                         night. Don't know if they were scared 
                         o' me or the Germans.

                                     ROSE
                              (quietly, always)
                         They are fiends out of hell... His 
                         whole life's work smashed. Ruined. 
                         In a few minutes.

                                     ALLNUT
                         The Reverend, eh?
                              (Rose nods)
                         Where's 'e now, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                              (pause; quietly)
                         He's dead.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I say, that's too bad! Pretty rough 
                         on you, Miss.
                              (embarrassed; trying 
                              to keep the ball 
                              rolling)
                         What'd 'e die of, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         They killed him.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (really a little 
                              surprised and shocked)
                         Well, now that's just awful! If 
                         they'll up and shoot a Reverend, who 
                         couldn't do 'em a bit a 'arm, there 
                         ain't nobody safe.

                                     ROSE
                         They didn't shoot him, Mr. Allnutt. 
                         But they are accountable to God just 
                         as surely as if they had.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Ow d'you mean, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         They broke his heart. He didn't take 
                         care of himself. He didn't want to 
                         live.

               She is looking into his eyes as if daring him to doubt or 
               disagree. He is timid, perceptive and kind enough not to 
               argue with her. After a moment, he avoids her eyes.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, Miss that's cert'nly too bad, 
                         that's all I can say.
                              (both are quiet and 
                              he is uneasy in the 
                              silence. Making 
                              conversation)
                         When'd 'e die, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         Early this morning.
                              (an odd gesture)
                         He's in there.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Hey!

                                     ROSE
                         I beg your pardon?

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Scuse it, Miss.
                              (delicately)
                         Wot I mean to say is -- the climate 
                         'n all -- quicker you get 'im under 
                         ground the better, if you don't mind 
                         me sayin' so.

               Rose nods.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (getting up)
                         Got a shovel?

                                     ROSE
                         Behind the bungalow.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Right. -- Tell ya wot. While I'm 
                         diggin' the grave, you get yer things 
                         together, Miss -- all the things ya 
                         want to take. Then we can clear out 
                         of 'ere.

                                     ROSE
                         Clear out?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Germans might come back any time.

                                     ROSE
                         Why should they? They left nothing.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh, they'll come back, all right. 
                         Lookin' for The African Queen. They'd 
                         dearly love to get their 'ooks on 
                         'er. She's the only power boat on 
                         the river.

                                     ROSE
                         Where will we go?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I thought, Miss, 'ow we might find 
                         somewhere quiet behind an island. 
                         Then we could talk about what to do.

                                     ROSE
                              (a pause; then with 
                              quick decision)
                         I'll get my things ready.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Fine, Miss, I'll be quick's I can.

               He starts for the front door.

                                     ROSE
                         Thank you, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You'd do the same for me, Miss.

               As he thinks it over, he begins to wonder, literal-mindedly, 
               whether she really would. He goes on out.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- AT THE GRAVE

               They stand on opposite sides of the new grave. At its head 
               is an improvised cross, two pieces of wood carefully and 
               securely wired together.

               Rose is reading the last lines of the burial service from a 
               Methodist or Presbyterian prayerbook.

               She reads rather badly; (i.E., with the Protestant shadings 
               of "expressiveness") yet between the language and the conflict 
               between restraint and deep emotion in her voice, it is quite 
               moving. Allnutt, while she reads, is trying to pay polite 
               attention; he even says "Amen", and such, in a sheepish kind 
               of way. But his eyes keep sliding uneasily to the jungle; 
               the Germans really do worry him.

               When she has finished, she stands very silent, for longer 
               than he can take. He tries reasonably hard, but finally he 
               has to speak.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, Miss, let's get outa here while 
                         the gettin's good.

               Rose, without looking at him or at the grave, and without 
               speaking, walks away; he picks up his spade and follows.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT at the edge of the porch. 
               Rose pauses, looks over towards Brother's grave for the last 
               time. Allnutt stands beside her, carrying her suitcase, not 
               wanting to hurry her again, but wishing she'd get a move on.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- (SHOOTING PAST THEM, 
               FROM THE INSIDE EDGE OF THE PORCH)

               By the turn of her head, our eye is led across the scarified 
               clearing. We see the stunted cross and the overwhelming jungle 
               and, perhaps, a little of the chapel.

                                     ROSE
                              (really meaning it; 
                              but very restrained 
                              and prim)
                         It was very kind of you, Mr. Allnutt, 
                         to think of the cross.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Shucks. Just seemed like he oughta 
                         have one, him a Reverend 'n all.

               Rose walks down the steps and towards the river. Allnutt 
               eagerly keeps pace. We SWING the CAMERA losing the grave, 
               and passing and losing the chapel, and centering them getting 
               smaller along the bare ground in the hot sunlight, bringing 
               in the river beyond them.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Careful now, Miss. Watch your step. 
                         That's right.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- OF AFRICAN QUEEN AT ANCHOR (SHOOTING 
               PAST BOW) and keeping the noisy SOUND of the water. We pick 
               up Rose and Allnutt as Allnutt helps her aboard. In her long 
               and somewhat narrow skirt she is distinctly old-maidish.

                                     ROSE
                              (with the upward 
                              English inflection -- 
                              a little as if he 
                              had passed her a 
                              teacup)
                         Thank -- you?

               Allnutt steps aboard.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT Rose sits down at the rear 
               of the boat and looks around her. Her feet are drawn under 
               her and knees close together and hands lightly folded on her 
               knees (perhaps a lady's scrap of handkerchief in one hand), 
               as prim, genteel and ladylike as if, on a holiday afternoon, 
               she were about to be rowed across an artificial lake fifty 
               yards wide. And that is more or less the way she glances 
               about her in her new surroundings -- politely and 
               restrainedly, as if a little critical of a parlor somewhat 
               humbler than her own.

               (This SHOT, at the very beginning of her voyage, is to be 
               quite touching, delicate and ironical, and through her very 
               genteelism and total unconcern for what she is up against -- 
               an unawareness -- we begin already to sense her complete 
               intrepidity.)

               Allnutt pauses to light up a cigarette before getting to 
               work. He hangs the cigarette inside his upper lip. This 
               cigarette, dead or alive, is a chronic fixture with Allnutt.

               Allnutt kneels in the bottom of the boat and addresses himself 
               to the engine. He hauls out a panful of hot ashes and dumps 
               them overside with a sizzle and a splutter. He fills the 
               furnace with fresh wood from a pile beside him, and soon 
               smoke appears from the funnel, and we hear the ROAR of the 
               draught. The engine begins to sigh and splutter, and then 
               begins to leak gray pencils of steam. Allnutt peers at his 
               gauges, thrusts in some more wood, and then leaps forward 
               around the engine, displaying monkeyish agility in handling 
               more tasks than he quite has the hands or the stamina for. 
               With grunts and heaves of the small windlass, he hauls in 
               the anchor, the sweat pouring from him in rivers. We see 
               already that he is physically not a strong man.

               Allnutt thrusts mightily at the muddy bank with a long pole, 
               snatches the pole on board again, and then rushes aft to the 
               tiller.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Scuse me, Miss.

               He sweeps her aside unceremoniously (she is astonished but 
               quickly reassembles herself) and he puts the tiller over 
               just in time to save the boat from running into the bank.

               CAMERA IN on Rose, resettling her plumage, and on Allnutt at 
               the tiller. The river bank starts to swing in square to the 
               stern. Their eyes are past the CAMERA.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- (MOVING WITH BOAT) -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT Rose 
               is deeply sad and very tired, but a very quiet kind of 
               exhilaration is already growing in her; and still more 
               clearly, her calm and tremendous, unreflecting resoluteness 
               begins to show.

               A pause.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yerss...?

                                     ROSE
                         What are the chances of our getting 
                         out through Limbasi on the railway 
                         to the Coast?

                                     ALLNUT
                         The railway was in German 'ands when 
                         I was in Limbasi -- and by this time 
                         Limbasi is too, I'll bet.

                                     ROSE
                         Then how do we get out, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         You got me, Miss.
                              (after a pause)
                         We've got 'eaps of grub 'ere, Miss, 
                         so we're all right, far as that goes. 
                         Two thousand cigarettes, two cases 
                         of gin. We could find a good 'iding 
                         place an' stay there for months if 
                         we want to.

               Rose's astonishment at this suggestion keeps her from 
               replying.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (rattling on)
                         I spose there's goin' to be a fight. 
                         If our troops come from the sea, 
                         they'll attack up the railway to 
                         Limbasi, I spose. In that case, the 
                         best thing we could do would be to 
                         wait round down 'ere an' just go up 
                         to Limbasi when the time came. -- On 
                         the other 'and, they might come down 
                         from British East, an' if they do 
                         that we'd 'ave the Germans between 
                         us and them all the time. Same if 
                         they came from Rhodesia or Portuguese 
                         East. We're in a bit of a fix, 
                         whichever way y'look at it, Miss.
                              (abruptly)
                         Mind takin' the tiller, Miss?

               Allnutt stands up and Rose takes over the tiller, holding 
               the iron rod resolutely. Allnutt goes to his engine and is 
               violently active once more. He pulls open the furnace door 
               and thrusts in a few sticks of fuel; then he scrambles up 
               into the bow and stands balanced on the cargo. The river is 
               studded with islands so that it appears as if there were a 
               dozen different channels.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Port a little, Miss.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE She is confused by the command.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Pull it over this side, I mean. -- 
                         That's it! Steady!

               MOVING SHOT -- THE LAUNCH The boat crawls up a narrow tunnel 
               of leaf and shade. (If color photography is used, the SHOT 
               would be startingly juicy and green -- many shades of green 
               reflected in rich brown water.)

               Allnutt comes leaping back over the cargo and shuts off the 
               engine; the propeller stops vibrating.

               Allnutt dashes into the bow again. Just as the trees (SHOOTING 
               PAST ROSE and her interest in it) begin apparently to move 
               forward again as the current overcomes the boat's way, he 
               lets go the anchor with a rattling CRASH, and almost without 
               a jerk the launch comes to a standstill.

               A great silence seems to close in on them -- the silence of 
               a tropical river at noon. The only SOUND is the subdued rush 
               and gargle of the water. The sober air is filled with a 
               strange light -- a green light.

               Allnutt turns from his work at the anchor. He and Rose look 
               about them and at each other, for a moment mysteriously 
               bemused by the stillness and by the beauty of the place. The 
               sudden quietness and the look of the place are richly 
               romantic; the two people are quieted by it, but they are 
               wholly unaware of any such potentiality between them. They 
               are just a couple of oddly assorted derelicts who hardly 
               even know each other, and don't care for what little they 
               know.

               A pause.

                                     ALLNUT
                         So far so good. 'Ere we are safe an' 
                         sound, as you might say.
                              (he beams upon his 
                              surroundings)
                         Not too bad a spot, is it, Miss, to 
                         sit a war out in? All the comforts 
                         of 'ome, includin' runnin' water.

               He laughs at his joke and is disappointed when Rose does not 
               join him.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm afraid, Mr. Allnutt, that what 
                         you suggest is quite impossible.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Ave you got any ideas?
                              (he takes a map out 
                              of his pocket and 
                              hands it to her)
                         'Ere's a map, Miss. Show me the way 
                         out an' I'll take it.

               Rose opens the map and starts studying it.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (after a while)
                         One thing sure; our men won't come 
                         up from the Congo, not even if they 
                         want to. They'd 'ave to cross the 
                         lake, and nothin' won't cross the 
                         lake while The Louisa is there.

                                     ROSE
                              (blankly)
                         The Louisa? What's that?

                                     ALLNUT
                         It's an 'undred-ton German steamer, 
                         Miss, and she's the boss o' the lake 
                         'cause she's got a six-pounder.

                                     ROSE
                         What's that?

                                     ALLNUT
                         A gun, Miss. The biggest gun in 
                         Central Africa.

                                     ROSE
                         I see.

                                     ALLNUT
                         If it wasn't for The Louisa, there 
                         wouldn't be nothin' to it. The Germans 
                         couldn't last a month if our men 
                         could get across the lake... But all 
                         this doesn't get us any nearer 'ome, 
                         does it, Miss? Believe me, if I could 
                         think wot we could do...

                                     ROSE
                         This river, the Ulanga, runs into 
                         the lake, doesn't it?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, Miss, it does; but if you was 
                         thinkin' of goin' to the lake in 
                         this launch -- well, you needn't 
                         think about it any more. We can't 
                         and that's certain.

                                     ROSE
                         Why not?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rapids, Miss. Cataracts and gorges. 
                         There's an 'undred miles of rapids 
                         down there. Why, the river's even 
                         got a different nyme where it comes 
                         out on the lake to what it's called 
                         up 'ere. It's the Bora down there. 
                         No one knew they was the same river 
                         until that chap Spengler --

                                     ROSE
                         He got down it. I remember.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes, Miss, in a dugout canoe. 'E 'ad 
                         half a dozen Swahili paddlers. Map 
                         makin', 'e was. In fact, that's 'is 
                         map you're lookin' at. There's places 
                         where this ole river goes shootin' 
                         down there like out of a fire 'ose. 
                         We couldn't never get this ole launch 
                         through.

               While he talks, Rose begins to look restive and vague, as 
               well as discouraged. By the time he is through, she has stood 
               up, CAMERA WITH HER; she hardly hears him. She strolls a 
               little aimlessly PAST THE CAMERA, which SWINGS TO CENTER HER 
               BACK as she walks forward. As if half in her sleep, she 
               sidesteps the engine.

               REVERSE ANGLE -- ROSE (SHOOTING FROM THE BOW) as Rose 
               sidesteps. She walks toward CAMERA into MEDIUM CLOSE UP, 
               eyes glazing with dreamlike concentration. She sees something 
               before and below her eye-level; stops, focusing on it.

               CLOSE SHOT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE) -- THE GELATINE CASES not 
               marked or labeled as such.

                                     ALLNUT
                         That's blastin' gelatine, Miss.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE (SHOOTING FROM BOW)

                                     ROSE
                              (head towards him, 
                              away from CAMERA)
                         Isn't it dangerous?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Bless you, no, Miss, that's safety 
                         stuff, that is. It can get wet and 
                         not do any 'arm. If you set fire to 
                         it, it just burns. You can 'it it 
                         wiv an 'ammer and it won't go off -- 
                         at least I don't fink it will. It 
                         takes a detonator to set it off. 
                         I'll put it over the side if it 
                         worries you though.

                                     ROSE
                              (sharply, yet absently 
                              as she turns into 
                              CAMERA)
                         No. We may need it.

               Allnutt keeps watching her idly, a little amused and very 
               slightly contemptuous. She wanders away from the boxes, eyes 
               downcast in thought, and pauses again.

                                     ROSE
                              (not looking up)
                         Mr. Allnutt --

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yeah?

               INSERT -- THE STEEL CYLINDERS IN BOTTOM OF BOAT

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         And what are these queer long round 
                         things?

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE BOW -- (PAST ROSE -- ON ALLNUTT)

                                     ALLNUT
                         Them's the oxygen and hydrogen 
                         cylinders, Miss. Ain't no good to 
                         us, though. Next time I shift cargo, 
                         I'll dump 'em.

               CLOSER SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (sharply, yet still 
                              more subconsciously 
                              and quietly than 
                              before)
                         I wouldn't do that.

               She keeps looking down at them, musingly, "subconsciously," 
               while CAMERA CREEPS CLOSER to her.

                                     ROSE
                         They look like -- like torpedoes.

               "Torpedoes" is spoken over:

               INSERT -- CYLINDERS -- a new and most deadly possible looking 
               SHOT of the cylinders.

               STILL CLOSER SHOT -- ROSE Slowly she raises her eyes from 
               floor angle to normal; a wild light is dawning in her eyes.

                                     ROSE
                              (in the voice almost 
                              of a medium)
                         Mr. Allnutt --

               She turns very slowly towards him.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE)

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a little bit smug)
                         I'm still right here, Miss, and on a 
                         thirty-foot boat there ain't much of 
                         any place else I could be.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE) walking 
               slowly and somewhat portentously towards him.

                                     ROSE
                              (full of the wild 
                              light)
                         You're a machinist, aren't you? Wasn't 
                         that your position at the mine?

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE)

               CAMERA ADVANCING on him at Rose's pace, stopping, looking 
               down, during his last six or eight words.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (comfortably)
                         Yeah, kind of fixer. Jack of all 
                         trades and master o' none, like they 
                         say.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE) disconcertingly 
               close.

                                     ROSE
                         Could you make a torpedo?

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Come again, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         Could you make a torpedo.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                         You don't really know what you're 
                         askin', Miss. It's this way, you 
                         see. A torpedo is a very complicated 
                         piece of machinery what with 
                         gyroscopes an' compressed air chambers 
                         an' vertical and horizontal rudders 
                         an' compensating weights. Why, a 
                         torpedo costs at least a thousand 
                         pounds to make.

               He relaxes; his manner is "The State Rests."

               SWING CAMERA to center Rose, still perched on the gunwale.

                                     ROSE
                              (after a short pause; 
                              unperturbed)
                         But all those things, those gyroscopes 
                         and things, they're only to make it 
                         go, aren't they?

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (NEUTRAL ANGLE)

                                     ALLNUT
                         Uh-huh. Go -- and hit what it's goin' 
                         after.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

                                     ROSE
                              (at the height of her 
                              inventiveness; the 
                              words triumphant and 
                              almost stumbling out)
                         Well! We've got The African Queen.

               She stands up with these words, CAMERA RISING with her, 
               SHOOTING FROM A LITTLE BELOW; her eager eyes are constantly 
               on Allnutt.

                                     ROSE
                         If we put this -- this blasting stuff -- 
                         in the front of the boat here -- and 
                         a -- what did you say -- deno -- 
                         detonator there, why that would be a 
                         torpedo, wouldn't it?

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT looking up at her, greatly amused, 
               almost sardonically admiring her.

                                     ROSE'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Those cylinders. They could stick 
                         out over the end, with that gunpowder 
                         stuff in them and the detonator in 
                         the tips where the taps are.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

                                     ROSE
                         Then if we ran the boat against the 
                         side of a ship, they'd -- well, they'd 
                         go off, just like a torpedo.
                              (somewhat doubtfully, 
                              in a return to her 
                              submissive feminine 
                              habit)
                         Wouldn't they?

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                              (tremendously amused; 
                              gravely)
                         That might work.
                              (humoring her along, 
                              and a little taken 
                              in by his own fondness 
                              for makeshift)
                         Them cylinders'd do right enough. I 
                         could let the gas out of 'em and 
                         fill 'em up with the gelignite. I 
                         could fix up a detonator all right. 
                         Revolver cartridge'd do.
                              (warming up to it, as 
                              an impossible project)
                         Why, sure, we could cut 'oles in the 
                         bows of the launch, and 'ave the 
                         cylinders stickin' out through them, 
                         so's to get the explosion near the 
                         water. Might turn the trick. But 
                         what would 'appen to us? It would 
                         blow this ole launch and us and 
                         everything all to Kingdom come.

                                     ROSE
                         I wasn't thinking that we should be 
                         in the launch. Couldn't we get 
                         everything ready and have a -- what 
                         do you call it -- a good head of 
                         steam up and point the launch toward 
                         the ship and then dive off before it 
                         hit? Wouldn't that do?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Might work, Miss. But what are we 
                         talkin' about, anyway. There ain't 
                         nothin' to torpedo. 'Cause The African 
                         Queen's the only boat on the river.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, yes there is.

                         Something to torpedo.

                                     ALLNUT
                         An' what's that, Miss?

                                     ROSE

                              amazement. Then, 
                              patiently)
                         Don't talk silly, Miss. You can't do 
                         that. Honest you can't. I told you 
                         before we can't get down the river.

                         In a canoe, Miss!

               Rose looks stubborn.

                                     ROSE
                         If a German did it, we can, too.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Not in no launch. We wouldn't 'ave a 
                         prayer.

                                     ROSE
                         How do you know? You've never tried.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Never tried shootin' myself through 
                         the 'ead, neither.
                              (pause)
                         Trouble with you is, you just don't 
                         know nothin' about boats, or water.

               A pause. They look at each other, Rose much more fixedly and 
               searchingly than Allnutt

                                     ROSE
                         In other words, you are refusing to

                         I didn't say that.

                                     ROSE
                         Well then --!

                                     ALLNUT
                              (sighs deeply)
                         'Ave it your own way, Miss -- only 
                         don't blame me, that's all.

               Allnutt stands perplexed and inarticulate, his cigarette 
               drooping from his upper lip. His wandering gaze strays from 
               Rose's feet, up her white drill frock to her face; he starts 
               slightly at her implacable expression.

                                     ROSE
                         Very well, let's get started.

                                     ALLNUT
                         What! Now, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                              (impatiently)
                         Yes, now. Come along.

                                     ALLNUT
                         There isn't two hours of daylight 
                         left, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                         We can go a long way in two hours.

               Allnutt starts to speak; refrains; limps over to windlass 
               and raises the anchor. Rose watches him. CAMERA PANS after 
               The African Queen as Allnutt backs her out into the channel, 
               then turns her nose downstream.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

               He is at the tiller -- back to CAMERA; Rose, standing looking 
               downstream. The Mission clearing on the bank, which they now 
               approach, is unobserved by both of them. Presently pencils 
               of steam begin coming out of the engine. Allnutt, feeling 
               that it requires his attention, signals to Rose, who takes 
               his place at the tiller. Allnutt goes to the engine and begins 
               to tinker.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT -- (ROSE IN B.G.)

                                     ALLNUT
                         A lot o' the time I'm going to 'ave 
                         more than enough to do, keepin' the 
                         ole engine goin.' So you might as 
                         well start learnin' to steer right 
                         now.

               Rose nods. Her hand takes a firmer, more authoritative hold 
               on the tiller.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (continuing)
                         She ain't no one-man boat, the Queen. 
                         Not in the shape she's in.

               Rose again shifts her hand a little; and she sits up very 
               straight with her new sense of responsibility.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Know port from starboard, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         I've heard of them.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, that's port --
                              (gesturing)
                         -- an' that's starboard.

                                     ROSE
                         Isn't that a bit -- well, silly? Why 
                         not just say left and right?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, spose yer facin' the other way 
                         in the boat an' I say "to the left." 
                         You might think I meant to your left, 
                         see, an' move to starboard. It's the 
                         boat ya gotta think of, see? So port's 
                         always that side --
                              (gesturing)
                         -- an' starboard, that -- an' 
                         forrard's always up there an' aft is 
                         where we are right now -- no matter 
                         what way we're turned around or the 
                         boat is headed.

                                     ROSE
                         Why yes, I see. It's really quite -- 
                         sensible, isn't it?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Uh huh. Okay. Now go easy, Miss -- 
                         light on the tiller. Now steer her 
                         just a little to starboard.

               Rose puts the tiller to starboard; the launch swerves a little 
               to port. She looks at Allnutt, bewildered. Allnutt is quietly 
               amused.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Okay, Miss, just straighten her out 
                         again.
                              (using flat hands to 
                              demonstrate)
                         Now looky here. Here's yer tiller.
                              (he extends his right 
                              hand)
                         Here's yer rudder.
                              (he extends his left 
                              hand, below and beyond 
                              his right)
                         They're joined. Tiller sets the 
                         rudder, rudder steers the boat.
                              (he slants both hands 
                              rigidly to one side)

                                     ROSE
                              (eagerly)
                         Oh, I see!

               Rose lifts her own hand from the tiller to show; the boat 
               yaws abruptly.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Tiller, Miss!

               Rose, startled, grabs the tiller and rights her course.

                                     ROSE
                              (blushing)
                         Sorry.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'S all right, just don't never do 
                         that, 's all.

                                     ROSE
                         Why, the water -- well -- pushes 
                         against the rudder, where it turns, 
                         and -- sort of drags the boat that 
                         way. Turns it.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You're catchin' on fine, Miss.

               Rose looks as pleased as if she had personally invented the 
               rudder.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Now a little to starboard, Miss. 
                         Easy now.
                              (Rose does it right)
                         Fine. Now a little to port.
                              (Rose does it right)

                                     ROSE
                         Is that all there is to it?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, ya gotta know how to read the 
                         river.

                                     ROSE
                         Read?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Ya gotta know the water an' what's 
                         under it, that ya gotta steer clear 
                         of.

                                     ROSE
                         Steer clear of. Why, that's where 
                         that expression comes from.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (uninterested)
                         Uh huh. Mostly ya can tell it by the 
                         surface o' the water. Now ya see 
                         that long thing out there like a "V" 
                         kinda?

               LONG SHOT -- ACROSS THE LINE

               a long, quiet "V" on the water.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         That always means a snag. Limb 
                         stickin' up from a dead tree; likes 
                         o' that.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                         Stay off them "Vs," they're murder.

               Rose looks very seriously, almost reprimandingly, towards 
               the "V."

               LONG SHOT -- A DIFFERENT PART OF THE RIVER

               The higher light shows it is later in the morning. In the 
               distance, past smooth water, a choppy patch.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Now all that little choppin', them's 
                         shallas, Miss.

               TWO SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

               Rose's eyes move from the shallows to steering; she shifts 
               course a little, and a long "V" trails past.

               LONG SHOT -- FORWARD ALONG THE BOAT

               as she resets her course.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               her eyes to starboard. Again the light is later. Rose's face 
               is a shade more pleased and in bloom than before.

                                     ROSE
                              (pointing)
                         What's that queer flat place, Mr. 
                         Allnutt?

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- ANOTHER PART OF THE RIVER

               at medium distance off starboard bow, an odd flat turbulence 
               in otherwise easy water.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         That's a rock. An' it ain't only a 
                         few inches under water. The Queen's 
                         got a shalla draft, an' that's where 
                         we're lucky. 'Cause anythin' ya can't 
                         read on the surface, we're safe to 
                         go right over it.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- (HIGHER LIGHT)

               The BEAT of the engine alters a little.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Only thing to worry us is much of a 
                         breeze. I reckon you know why.

               The BEAT of the engine alters still more.

                                     ROSE
                         It makes us -- it -- pushes the boat 
                         around?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Naw. It chops the water so --

               He rushes forward to the engine.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE ENGINE -- ALLNUTT

               starts rapping the boiler's safety-valve smartly with a 
               wrench. After a few socks, it blows off steam.

               WIDE SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

                                     ALLNUT
                              (loud, over his 
                              shoulder, while steam 
                              blows off)
                         Chops it up so bad ya can't see no 
                         signs to warn ya.

                                     ROSE
                              (louder)
                         Oh. Of course.

               Allnutt is intently busy at the feed pump -- this time, a 
               brief operation. Rose watches him out; he does a little 
               refueling. (Wood is piled high in the waist now, drying in 
               the sun.)

               (NOTE: From here on until indicated, no TWO SHOTS. Allnutt 
               is amidship, in hot sunlight; Rose, at stern, in cool, breezy 
               shadow of awning.)

                                     ROSE
                         What was the matter, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Feed pump choked. An' one o' my boys 
                         dropped sumpin in the safety valve; 
                         can't count on it, ya gotta hit it.

                                     ROSE
                         What happens when the feed pump 
                         chokes?

               He finishes fueling and sits down and dries his sweat.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Whole boiler can blow up. Specially 
                         the shape she's in. This water's 
                         awful muddy. Rots the tubes, plugs 
                         'em up with scale. 'Sides that, the 
                         pressure gauge is kinda on the blink. 
                         Can't count on it fer sure, but ya 
                         can't forget it, neither. Bring 'er 
                         higher'n fifteen pound, the whole 
                         engine starts fallin' apart. An' 
                         much less'n that, she quits. Oh, 
                         come to think of it. Know why I got 
                         to keep the engine goin'?

                                     ROSE
                         Why, so we can go, of course.

                                     ALLNUT
                         That ain't wot I mean.

               Rose looks blank, and interested.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Cause if the engine dies ya ain't 
                         got enough --

                                     ROSE
                         Oh. The water doesn't push against 
                         the rudder hard enough to --

                                     ALLNUT
                              (nodding approvingly)
                         That's right. No steerage-way. An' 
                         in bad water that's life or death.

               Rose looks at him, for the first time aware that he is as 
               important to navigation as she is.

                                     ALLNUT
                         If you steer wrong we're goners; if 
                         I let the engine die, we're goners, 
                         too.

               He adds another couple of pieces of wood. Rose nods, and 
               takes on both a sense of dignity and a sense of 
               interdependence.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (proudly)
                         Oh, she's fulla tricks, this ole 
                         engine. Even the fuelin'. Ya gotta 
                         fuel 'er light an' steady, keep the 
                         pressure right. An' that ain't so 
                         easy as it sounds, Miss. 'Cause wood 
                         makes an awful lotta ash an' chokes 
                         yer draft. Ya gotta plan it all very 
                         careful. Empty the ash pan, ya gotta 
                         figure 'ow it'll change yer draft. 
                         Ya got 'alf a dozen different kinds 
                         o' wood an' every one burns different. 
                         Got to figure on wot the heat o' the 
                         sun does to the boiler, different 
                         times o' day. An' that safety valve. 
                         An' the water pipes keep springin' 
                         leaks, an' the water gauge just works 
                         when she's a mind to.
                              (he looks over the 
                              whole engine with 
                              affection)
                         You got to know 'ow she's feelin', 
                         Miss -- keep a step ahead of 'er. 
                         Right now she's got 'er best foot 
                         forrard 'cause there's a stranger 
                         aboard. But don't be took in, Miss. 
                         Wait till you see 'er in a mean 
                         streak.

               He puts on a little more fuel, and lights a cigarette.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE BOILER AND ENGINE HEAD-ON

               like an altar. Allnutt lounges in one side of the SHOT like 
               an acolyte, and quietly watches toward Rose, steering.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               steering. There is something regal about the way she sits 
               holding the tiller, as though it were a scepter.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXT. THE RIVER -- TWILIGHT

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE PROW OF THE LAUNCH

               as it noses upstream along a narrow channel. A swerve and a 
               steadying; the prow advances into MEDIUM CLOSE UP; the anchor 
               starts to drop. Before it hits the water:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE FA?ADE OF THE ENGINE

               with SPLASH and RATTLE of anchor and chain o.s., as Allnutt 
               rushes into the SHOT and shuts off steam. The pencils of 
               steam abruptly fade and drift.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               standing very attentively. PAST HIM, a wall of leaves shows 
               that the boat, after a couple of inches of drift, stops 
               gently. He still stands attentive, as if he were listening 
               in the abrupt new silence. He is much more grimy and sweaty 
               than before.

                                     ALLNUT
                         It's 'ot work, ain't it, Miss? I 
                         could do with a drink.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               He goes to the locker beside Rose, produces two dirty enamel 
               cups. Watching him, Rose frowns slightly. Then, from under 
               the bench he drags out a wooden case. From the case he brings 
               out a bottle. He opens the bottle, proceeds to pour a liberal 
               portion into one of the cups.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               watching with a kind of fascination.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               as he makes a movement with the bottle toward the second 
               cup.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Ave one, Miss?

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (horrified whisper)
                         What is it?

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Gin, Miss. And there's only river 
                         water to drink it with.

                                     ROSE
                              (appalled)
                         No!

               MEDIUM CLOSE UP OF ALLNUTT -- (ROSE'S VIEWPOINT)

               He dips the empty mug overside. He turns back straight and, 
               with care, decants the water into the gin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               She is in conflict between her intensifying fascination, and 
               her sense of actually watching something forbidden and even 
               outrageous. Impulses play through her, covertly suggested in 
               her face, to protest, to appeal to his better nature, even 
               to snatch the drink from him. And now a new shading enters 
               her face. All she has seen up to now as mere preparation for 
               sin: now she is witnessing Sin itself. Something related to 
               fear begins to enter her face.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE)

               He slaps casually at a mosquito, and lifts the mug for a 
               second swig.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               eyes still more fixed, fascinated and full of wild doubts 
               and suppositions.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE)

               Allnutt lowers the mug. Happier now than before, he glances 
               at Rose in an impersonal way; looks away; looks back in doubt 
               at her, mildly puzzled by what he sees, but not interested.

               STILL CLOSER SHOT -- ROSE

               as she watches him very sharp. She is puzzled by how quiet 
               and peaceable he is, but she knows better than to trust him. 
               She is waiting for the trouble she is sure is bound to come. -
               o.s., Allnutt hiccups slightly. She tightens and withdraws a 
               little more, then comes to a standstill.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT (FROM ROSE'S VIEWPOINT)

               He looks up again, a little more puzzled.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Somethin' the matter, Miss?

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (shortly)
                         No.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               Still a bit puzzled, he raises his mug and finishes his drink 
               off. Across this nice, long drink:

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               Rose's whole body and posture is as withdrawn, pinched and 
               tense as her face.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (setting down his cup)
                         Now, Miss, 'ow 'bout some tea?

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               By the way she lets out a long, long-held breath, we realize 
               for the first time the extremity of tension she has been 
               under.

               PULL AWAY to INCLUDE ALLNUTT, as Rose relaxes all over, all 
               but trembling, between relief and her ravenous need for tea.

                                     ROSE
                              (able to speak now)
                         Ohhh! Yes!

               CAMERA PANS with Allnutt as he goes over to the boiler. He 
               draws hot water into the two cups, then places them on the 
               bench before her and makes tea.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (stirring)
                         'Course it tastes a bit rusty, but 
                         you can't 'ave everything.
                              (a little formally)
                         Sugar, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                              (also a little formally)
                         'k you?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a little bit caught 
                              by her tea-party 
                              manner; bashfully)
                         don't mention it.

               Allnutt brings out a lantern and lights it. They both drink.

               She takes a ladylike trial sip; then really guzzles as never 
               before. Sweat starts out on her forehead and she shuts her 
               eyes. Across her bringing down the cup:

                                     ROSE
                              (in a tea-wet voice, 
                              more relaxed and 
                              female than at any 
                              time before)
                         It's simply delicious!

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                              (surprised, and 
                              somewhat pleased)
                         Not 'alf bad, is it!

               He tastes his again. Living to himself, he has not been much 
               interested in taste and such.

               Rose sets down her cup and, angling her sharp, long-sleeved 
               elbows high, extracts a long pin from her hat, lays it beside 
               her and lifts the big, dark hat from her head and lays that 
               beside her too, and carefully thrusts the pin back into the 
               hat and briefly tidies her tight hair. Then, picking up her 
               cup again, she drains the last of her tea.

                                     ROSE
                              (holding out her cup)
                         If you please?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Right.
                              (he starts the business 
                              of making tea again)
                         'Ow long you been out 'ere, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         Almost ten years.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You're from the midlands, ain't you?

                                     ROSE
                         Manchester.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Ever get 'omesick?

               He goes over and gets crackers and tinned meat out of the 
               locker.

                                     ROSE
                         Every day of my life.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I'd give my eye teeth to be back on 
                         a Saturday night, rubbin' elbows 
                         like they say -- all the jostlin' 
                         an' the noise an' the music -- ain't 
                         nothin' can touch it for cheering a 
                         chap up.

                                     ROSE
                         It's always Sunday afternoons I think 
                         of -- the peace and quiet.

               They are eating the meat and crackers as they talk.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I don't remember very much about the 
                         Sundays. I was always sleeping it 
                         off.

               They finish eating. For a few seconds they listen to the 
               quiet soliloquy of the water.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (continuing)
                         Didn't see no crocodiles in this 
                         arm, Miss, did you?

                                     ROSE
                         Crocodiles? No.

                                     ALLNUT
                         No shallas for 'em here. An' current's 
                         too fast.
                              (he coughs, a little 
                              self-consciously)
                         I could do with a bath, 'fore supper.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (spontaneous, 
                              unconsidered)
                         I'd like one too.

               She is a little surprised at herself, but not troubled.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                              (getting up)
                         I'll go up in the bows an' hang onto 
                         the anchor chain. You just stay back 
                         'ere an' do what you like to, Miss. 
                         Then, if we don't look, it won't 
                         matter.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               She is semi-aware of a change in herself, but still 
               irresistibly spontaneous.

                                     ROSE
                         Very well.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (PAST ROSE)

                                     ALLNUT
                              (hesitant)
                         Well...

                                     ROSE
                              (coolly)
                         Very well, Mr. Allnutt.

               He walks towards the bow, sidestepping the engine. Bring up 
               SOUND of water a little.

               REVERSE ANGLE -- ROSE

               Rose looks after him, checking the six-inch width of the 
               funnel which will stand between them; not much concerned. 
               While she watches, she is undoing her dress at its cuffs and 
               at its high neck. She stands and takes it off over her head 
               with a voluminous motion. She starts to remove an undergarment 
               and hesitates, frowning a little; compresses her lips and, 
               clearly, decides not to remove the garment.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE FUNNEL

               centered, in the lamplight. The water SOUND rises another 
               fraction; other SOUNDS fade a little.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE'S FEET IN THE WATER --

               not more than shin-deep. (She is sitting on the gunwale.) 
               The water distorts and drives and sways them a little and 
               she is moving them gently.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE (HEAD AND SHOULDERS)

               Her head bent forward, she is watching and quietly enjoying 
               her feet in the water.

               There is a little NOISE o.s.; her eyes slip a little in the 
               direction of the bow.

               TAIL-OF-THE-EYE SHOT -- PAST ENGINE AND FUNNEL

               A dim grayish-white shape lowers itself over the bow.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               eyes not too quickly forward. She is not shocked, excited, 
               or self-conscious; just calmly interested. (o.s., prodigious 
               KICKINGS and SPLASHINGS and WHOOSHINGS as Allnutt takes his 
               bath.) Slowly her head goes lower in the SHOT and her head 
               and shoulders begin to twist as she turns to cling to the 
               gunwale. Bring up WATER SOUND a little. As she lets her body 
               loose into the water, CAMERA SWINGS loose along it; it is 
               clear as she lengthens out and submerges that she is wearing 
               bloomers and camisole.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE'S FACE -- (PAST HER HANDS)

               clinging to the low, stern gunwale, as her arms stretch. 
               There is a deep and delicate sensuous enjoyment in her face; 
               her body lifts out full length behind her, a dim and water-
               addled blur. Then she pulls herself up towards the boat as 
               strongly as she can; her wet, strapped shoulders rise, and 
               one elbow clamps over the gunwale.

               VERTICAL INSERT -- SUITCASE

               Over SOUNDS of her vigorous drying o.s., the insect- and 
               moisture-proof tin suitcase or box in which Rose has packed 
               all her worldly goods. It is open. By lantern light some of 
               its contents are visible; a few garments and undergarments, 
               neatly folded; her prayer- or service-book and her Bible; 
               and a group photograph of Rose and Brother and their family, 
               in which the intention is to anchor Rose deep in English 
               puritanism. Perhaps eight seconds are allowed for a look at 
               this photograph; then Rose's thin, cleansed hands lay in the 
               dark dress in which she began this voyage; it is neatly 
               folded; it covers not only the picture but also the religious 
               books.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               Her head emerges from the white drill dress into which she 
               is shuffling herself; the head, with its slightly dampened 
               hair (which is still pinned up, but strands are loose) looks 
               so refreshed and integrated in the lantern light that it is 
               as if it were brand new. With somewhat freer motions than 
               she has made before, she pulls, straightens and pats the 
               dress, and buttons it at the bosom.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (o.s.)
                         Are you ready, Miss?

                                     ROSE
                         Yes.

               She glances past her shoulder towards him as she wrings out 
               a damp undergarment, overside. Allnutt comes past the engine 
               out of the shadows, into SHOT, carrying a couple of rolled 
               rugs.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You better sleep 'ere under the 
                         awnin', Miss, 'case it rains. 'Ere's 
                         a coupla rugs. There ain't no fleas 
                         in 'em.

                                     ROSE
                         Where will you sleep?

               He unrolls a rug and spreads it on the bottom of the boat as 
               he talks.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Forrard, Miss. I can fix up a sorta 
                         bed outa them cases.

                                     ROSE
                         The -- explosives?

               He spreads the other rug.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Sure, Miss. Won't do 'em no 'arm.

               The idea is queer to Rose, but everything is now.

                                     ROSE
                              (a little curtly)
                         All right.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Be sure you cover up good. Gets a 
                         bit chilly on the river, towards 
                         mornin'.

                                     ROSE
                         All right.

               Allnutt returns into the bow. SWING and HOLD CAMERA a couple 
               of seconds on the shadows; he is vaguely visible and there 
               are the SOUNDS of his arranging the gelatine cases.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               finishing her hair into the second of two short, tight braids. 
               She reaches into the tin box and under the dark dress and 
               brings out the folded spare clothing. SOUND of the picture 
               rattling against the bottom. With one hand she puts her hat 
               and her comb in on top. She closes the box. HOLD on the closed 
               box a moment.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (ANOTHER ANGLE)

               On one rug and beneath another, in her dress, Rose arranges 
               the spare clothes as a pillow and settles her head; from the 
               instant it settles she is immensely but not unhappily tired. 
               Over Allnutt's line, o.s., her eyes focus and follow his 
               sentence, sleepily in the lantern light.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         I'll turn out the light if you're 
                         ready, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                         Quite ready.

               The light on her face begins to dwindle.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER ANGLE)

               at the lantern. He turns it down. He neither looks at Rose 
               nor takes squeamish care not to.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (quietly, impersonally, 
                              when the light is 
                              very low)
                         'Night Miss.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               in the lowered light.

                                     ROSE
                              (as quietly and 
                              impersonally)
                         Good night, Mr. Allnutt.

               o.s., the SOUND of his blowing out the lantern; darkness.

               The darkness is almost total for a second; then there is 
               faint visibility. o.s., very subdued, the brief SOUNDS of 
               Allnutt's settling-down; then silence from him.

               Deeply subdued, the SOUNDS of water slowly dwindle and die 
               entirely, and Rose's eyes are closed. Her mouth softens a 
               little and opens a little; in sleep her face is even more 
               deeply virginal than when she is awake. But now in her sleep 
               one hand moves up to her throat and slips inside her dress, 
               next the skin.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               in a similar hovering SHOT, asleep in his nest of explosives-
               boxes. He is not snoring, but with each exhalation his lips 
               blow out lightly, with a small SOUND of "Puhhh" -- "Puhhh..." 
               In his sleep, comfortably, his fumbling hand scratches his 
               haunch. There is no sound of water.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               CLOSE SHOT -- ACROSS TOP OF AWNING -- (NIGHT)

               It is raining, quietly but firmly.

               CLOSE SHOT -- VERTICAL -- OVER ALLNUTT

               It is raining into his face. Not quite waking, he pulls his 
               blanket over his face.

               CLOSE SHOT -- VERTICAL -- ALLNUTT'S FEET

               as the pulled-up blanket exposes them to the quietly 
               increasing rain. They pull up under the blanket like a touched 
               snail into its shell.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT'S FACE

               He is peering disconsolately from under the torn blanket. 
               The rain is increasing. He glances aft.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- FULL-LENGTH

               The rain is bristling meanly all over the hunched blanket; 
               he gets up, wrapping it around him, and walks past CAMERA.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (PAST ROSE)

               He comes in under the leaky awning and on into a

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               as he comes under the awning as quietly as he can, clearly 
               trying not to wake up Rose. He lies down beside her, CAMERA 
               TILTING and bringing ROSE IN CLOSE UP, and rising into 
               VERTICAL TWO SHOT above them.

               Rose is asleep. He is being just as discreet and careful as 
               he can, but the margin of dryness is narrow; in avoidance of 
               leakiness, and efforts to settle himself comfortably, he 
               jostles her awake. She wakes up, facing him (his head and 
               body are turned from her) and instantly assumes the worst of 
               him. In profound shock and outrage, she sits up and clutches 
               her rug about her -- though she is wearing a dress.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Allnutt!

                                     ALLNUT
                              (turning, murmuring)
                         Sorry I woke you, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                              (across his line; her 
                              eyes cold blaze)
                         What are you doing here?

               He meets her eyes and understands what she thinks of him. He 
               is very much astonished and embarrassed.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                         Blimey, Miss!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (measuring her words, 
                              with her really 
                              terrifying quiet 
                              anger)
                         Get out -- this instant!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               He feels an explanation is hopeless and is beyond words 
               anyhow. He gets up out of the SHOT.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               settling down prostrate again. Her eyes follow him in cold 
               fury.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER VIEWPOINT)

               as he walks humbly out into the rain.

               A splendid outburst of THUNDER and LIGHTNING blinds and 
               deafens the SCREEN, and the rain really cuts loose.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               The thunderbolt makes her leap like a salmon; spray from the 
               rain gets at her face, even under the awning. Now she 
               understands and she is a bit embarrassed and sorry; her 
               changed eyes look at Allnutt.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER VIEWPOINT)

               He is sitting, hunched, in the open, patiently adjusting the 
               blanket over his head. He is facing away from her.

                                     ROSE
                              (o.s.)
                         Mr. Allnutt.

               Her voice is barely audible in smashing rain. He does not 
               hear.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (calling loudly)
                         Mr. Allnutt!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER VIEWPOINT)

               He turns his head sadly towards her.

                                     ROSE
                              (loud, o.s.)
                         You may come in out of the rain, Mr. 
                         Allnutt!

               He looks unsure of himself, but gets up and comes towards 
               her. He stumbles against an awning stanchion and gets a 
               cataract down his neck and comes along under the profusely 
               leaky awning towards Rose, stooping, then lying down and 
               adjusting his bedding; he is whimpering gently.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Thanks, Miss.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (PAST ALLNUTT)

                                     ROSE
                         Certainly, Mr. Allnutt.

               VERTICAL TWO SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

                                     ALLNUT
                              (after a pause)
                         Miss...

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Sorry I give you such a turn.

                                     ROSE
                         That's quite all right, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Thanks, Miss. Night.

                                     ROSE
                         Goodnight, Mr. Allnutt.

               He turns away from her and tries to make himself comfortable. 
               A quick drop-drip-dropping of water starts directly into his 
               face. He miserably pulls his head out of the way and it drops 
               loudly onto the boards beside him. Back to her, Allnutt 
               huddles into the dry space, doing his best not to touch her, 
               yet to stay dry.

               As CAMERA DESCENDS INTO CLOSE UP OF BOTH, he has already 
               dropped off. Upon one elbow she hovers over him, watching 
               him, with a strange cool virginal tenderness. Splatterings 
               of rain which have hit the bench above them, spray his 
               sleeping face. Gently but inhumanly, as if he were an ugly 
               little doll, she draws a corner of her rug across him, to 
               protect him.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               moving down the river. The water is almost painfully bright 
               in the midday sun.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               at the tiller. There is a new shading of pleasure and 
               confidence in her expression. She is almost smiling.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               in the killing sunlight, and beside the devastating heat of 
               fire and boiler (an extreme shimmering of heat waves); he is 
               half-drowned in sweat, yet his face is unconcerned as he 
               oils the cylinders.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ROSE
                         What a frightfully strong smell, 
                         isn't it! I suppose it's bound to be 
                         at its worst in the middle of the 
                         day.

                                     ALLNUT
                         What smell?

                                     ROSE
                         The river. I never realized before 
                         how very strongly it smells.

               Allnutt sniffs at it, curiously.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Hmm. So it does, now I notice it. 
                         Guess I'm on the water so much, I 
                         forget all about it.

                                     ROSE
                         It's like marigolds. Stale ones.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (tries again)
                         Don't guess I ever smelt no marigolds.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, they smell just like this.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Do, huh? Not a very good smell for a 
                         flower.

                                     ROSE
                         They're very pretty, though. 
                         Marigolds.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Are, eh?

               He puts on some more fuel. o.s., a NOISE of soft ROARING 
               begins. Allnutt's eyes hear it and look mean and happy; he 
               starts aft.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               as he sits down, with cruel and secret pleasure, the ROAR 
               loudens.

                                     ROSE
                         Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (all innocence)
                         Yes?

                                     ROSE
                         What is that roaring sound?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (licking his chops)
                         Oh, that? Rapids, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                         Really? So soon?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Just around the bend.
                              (pause)
                         Kind of dangerous.
                              (pause)
                         P'raps I better take over, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                         You be ready to -- but I'd like to 
                         try it.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (gloating)
                         Well -- maybe that's a good idear at 
                         that, Miss.
                              (malicious)
                         Learn by doin', like they say.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE RAPIDS

               Shooting against the prow of The African Queen, which is 
               charging downstream quite rapidly. The NOISE of water is 
               joltingly louder.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               Past him, wild water, rocks, a swiftly moving, ragged shore. 
               He is pretending to tinker with the engine, in order to leave 
               Rose alone with her fear. He is a little scared, knowing 
               that Rose is a neophyte at steering and being a woman, may 
               get rattled -- but mainly he is feeling fine -- by God, 
               this'll big rapids. He takes time off for a quick glance 
               back at her (o.s.); turning back to his tinkering, his face 
               is even more satisfied.

               ROSE -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- (FROM HIS ANGLE)

               Her face is extraordinarily chiseled and tense; her eyes are 
               hard as diamonds. We can easily suppose her expression to be 
               one of cold terror, as Allnutt does.

               NOTE:

               This SCENE is to last about thirty seconds. The rapids are 
               to be rough enough to excite and to give a considerable sense 
               of hazard, but they are mild compared to what will be seen 
               later on. A fair amount of the SCENE is just racing through 
               loud, ragged water, but there are to be perhaps three real 
               hazards. They might, for instance, be: the two rocks the 
               scene opens with; a buried rock, just spotted and avoided in 
               the nick of time, scaring the daylights out of Allnutt and 
               tightening Rose's face still more into this simulacrum of 
               fear (he is comforted out of his own fears, seeing this face); 
               and, caught between rocks, jutting into their only available 
               channel, a large jagged tree-limb, bony-looking as antlers. 
               There's no way out: Rose drives dead against it with an 
               instinct for the angle which will bring against it the most 
               powerful leverage: it hits hard and there is a tremendous 
               NOISE of CRACKING and BREAKAGE. Within another couple of 
               seconds they are in quieter water; within a couple more, the 
               water is almost normal, the ROAR is fading. The boat has 
               slowed down. The ENGINE SOUND is near normal balance; Rose 
               distinctly relaxes, and sits down; Allnutt relaxes at his 
               tinkering, and finishes it off with a bit of a flourish. 
               (From the breaking of the branches, SHOOT FROM AMIDSHIPS, 
               sternward, on Rose past Allnutt.)

               While he stands, back to Rose, finishing his tinkering, 
               Allnutt looks happy as a clam and thoroughly smug. 
               Everything's the way he wants it, now. He checks his gauges, 
               o.s., and turns away, and strolls back towards Rose with 
               something of a swagger.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               as Allnutt seats himself a little too smugly on the sternbench 
               at right angle to Rose. He sizes her up for a couple of 
               seconds, greatly relishing the moment.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (quietly gloating)
                         Well, Miss, had enough?

                                     ROSE
                         Enough? Of what, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         White water. Rapids. Now ya got a 
                         taste of it, how d'ya like it? Huh?

                                     ROSE
                         Very much indeed.
                              (Allnutt's eyes change; 
                              his mouth falls open 
                              a little)
                         I'd never dreamed that any -- any 
                         mere -- er -- physical experience 
                         could be so -- so stimulating.

               He just keeps looking at her. He begins to need a cigarette. 
               Without taking his eyes off her he gets one out. Rose is 
               quite unaware of what she is doing to Allnutt -- much 
               friendlier in her tone than ever before.

                                     ROSE
                              (fishing up the mot 
                              juste)
                         So -- exhilarating.

               Allnutt puts the cigarette between his lips, and gets out a 
               match; he is still watching her; every moment, he is more 
               and more deeply aghast.

                                     ROSE
                         I notice that near rocks, the water 
                         seems to push away from the rock. 
                         One must take that into account in 
                         steering, mustn't one?

               Allnutt scratches a match; it fails to light. He gets another.

                                     ROSE
                         You know, I've only known such -- 
                         excitement a few times before.

               His look inquires of her. He gets a match lighted.

                                     ROSE
                         A few times, in my dear Brother's 
                         sermons, when the Spirit was really 
                         upon him.

               Allnutt raises the match to light his cigarette. His eyes 
               leave hers for the lighting. His eyes look bruised and sick; 
               his hands are shaking. He stands up, in quiet desperation, 
               to beat it into her thick head.

                                     ROSE
                         Tell me, Mr. Allnutt.

               He looks up at her hopelessly.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (just managing to 
                              shape the sound)
                         Yes?

                                     ROSE
                         I steered rather well for a beginner, 
                         didn't I?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (without spirit)
                         Not so bad, Miss, considerin'. But 
                         that wasn't such bad water -- nothin' 
                         compared to what's farther on.

                                     ROSE
                         I can hardly wait!
                              (Allnutt looks as if 
                              he could wait quite 
                              a while. A pause)
                         Now that I've had a taste of it I 
                         don't wonder you love boating!

               He gives her one last flabbergasted, hopeless look, wheels 
               abruptly and walks away -- CAMERA SWINGING, losing Rose -- 
               and sits near the engine, turned away from her, looking 
               crumpled and beaten. He is still shaking his head. o.s., 
               blithely, Rose hums the opening bars of Guide Me, O Thou 
               Great Jehovah.

               Allnutt shifts a little as if to look at her; hasn't the 
               heart to; shudders faintly; and stretches his shaking hands 
               toward the furnace.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               DETAIL SHOT -- GIN BOTTLE (TWO-THIRDS FULL)

               as Allnutt pulls out cork, with luscious SOUND.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT (AT RIGHT ANGLES IN STERN SEATS)

               SHOT slightly favors Allnutt. Late twilight; the boat is 
               moored near a bank. Rose is taking a swallow of steaming 
               tea; she lowers her cup. Allnutt's full mug of tea stands 
               beside him on the bench, untouched.

               Rose watches him with interest. Allnutt lifts the bottle to 
               drink; he raises his eyes and meets hers; sullen and defiant. 
               He puts the bottle in his mouth, cocks it up and drinks deep 
               of neat gin; past the bottle, the hostility of his eyes 
               increases.

               Rose looks perplexed.

               The rum gin burns him; he has a brief spasm of the gasping 
               shakes. He tries not to show this, and avoids her eyes.

               Genuine concern blends with her perplexity.

                                     ROSE
                              (gently)
                         Is something the matter, Mr. Allnutt?

               He meets her eyes again, sullen, a little bitter. His eyes 
               still on hers, he raises the bottle, cocks it up showily, 
               and drinks again -- looking at her past the bottle. The gin 
               makes sweat start out on his forehead. He keeps on, though, 
               taking a deep drink, watching her all the time. Finally he 
               brings the bottle down. His eyes go out of focus, against 
               his will. And against his will and pride, he wipes the sweat 
               off his forehead with the palm of his hand, and the sweat 
               from his hand onto his shirt.

                                     ROSE
                              (gently, again)
                         Tell me.

               He looks at her with angry reproach. A pause.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (already affected by 
                              the gin; proud and 
                              sullen)
                         Nothin'.

               A pause. He raises the bottle; lowers it.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Nothin' you'd understand.

               He drinks.

                                     ROSE
                              (after waiting him 
                              out)
                         I want to understand. I just can't 
                         imagine what's the matter. It's been 
                         such a pleasant day.
                              (pause)
                         What is it, Mr. Allnutt?

               Allnutt looks at her bitterly. Suddenly he looks mad and 
               stands up. Just as suddenly he sits down again. This makes 
               him sore at her.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (bitterly; after a 
                              pause)
                         All this fool talk about The Louisa. 
                         Goin' down the river...

                                     ROSE
                         What do you mean?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I mean we ain't goin' to do nothin' 
                         of the sort.

               He needs a drink on this, but Rose interrupts.

                                     ROSE
                         Why, of course we're going! What an 
                         absurd idea!

                                     ALLNUT
                              (feeling his oats and 
                              his gin; mimicking 
                              nastily)
                         What an absurd idea! What an absurd 
                         idea! Lady, I may be a born fool, 
                         but you got ten absurd idears to my 
                         one, an' don't you forget it!
                              (pause. Speechless 
                              with scorn and 
                              resentment)
                         Huh!

               He drinks. A pause.

                                     ROSE
                              (with a glimmer of 
                              tact)
                         Why don't you want to go, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         What do I want to blow up sumpin' 
                         for? You tell me. Yeah. You tell me. 
                         That's all!

                                     ROSE
                              (quietly)
                         Why don't you want to go?

               A pause.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (sullenly)
                         Already come further'n I ever meant 
                         to. Don't hardly even know the river, 
                         this far down.
                              (bitterly and a little 
                              incoherently)
                         Only come this far 'cause there you 
                         was all by your lonesome, lost your 
                         brother and all -- wot you get for 
                         feelin' sorry for people.

                                     ROSE
                              (quietly)
                         Why, Mr. Allnutt?

                                     ALLNUT
                         This river. That's why. An' Shona.

                                     ROSE
                         Shona!

                                     ALLNUT
                              (mimicking her tone, 
                              nastily)
                         Shona!
                              (pause)
                         If there's any place along the whole 
                         river the Germans'll keep a lookout, 
                         it'll be Shona. 'Cause that's where 
                         the old road ferries over from the 
                         South.

                                     ROSE
                         But they can't do anything to us!

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh, they can't, eh? They got rifles, 
                         maybe machine guns, maybe even 
                         cannons, an' just one bullet in that 
                         blastin' gelatine an', Miss, what's 
                         left of us would be in bits and 
                         pieces.

                                     ROSE
                         Then we'll go by at night.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh no, we won't!

                                     ROSE
                              (with asperity)
                         Now why not?

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Cause the rapids start just a little 
                         ways below Shona, an' they ain't 
                         nobody in his right mind 'ud tackle 
                         'em even in daylight, let alone at 
                         night.

                                     ROSE
                         Then we'll go in daylight. We'll go 
                         on the far side of the river from 
                         Shona, just as fast as ever we can.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a sudden realization. 
                              Boozily, sorely)
                         -- Say, who do you think you are, 
                         all this we'll do this an' we'll do 
                         that? 'Oose boat is this, any'ow? 
                         'Oo asked you aboard? Huh? Huh? You 
                         crazy, psalm-singin', skinny old 
                         maid.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               In the first phase of realization, her lower lip thrusts out 
               like a shovel or like the lower lip of a baby within a stone's 
               throw of crying, and her eyes look soft with dampness. Then 
               she catches her lower lip between her teeth in her effort to 
               restrain herself, and her eyes harden with self-discipline. 
               Then she doesn't need the teeth any more. Her lips are tight 
               and thin. Her whole face is edgy. Her eyes are hard with 
               bitter resentment and with hatred. Slowly, without moving 
               her head or altering her face, she lifts her tea into the 
               SHOT and drinks, and lowers the cup out of the SHOT. Her 
               face grows still harder and more immovable.

               Against this, o.s., mostly in breathy, lonesome undertone, 
               on one or two phrases loudly and assertively, Allnutt is 
               singing, rottenly and inchoately, some part of the following:

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.; singing)
                         Gimmy regards ter Leicester Square 
                         Sweet Piccadilly an' Myefair, Remember

                         under-sta-and.

               SLOW FADE on Rose as first daylight begins to appear. FADE 
               IN

                                                                 SLOW FADE:

               EXT. RIVER AND THE AFRICAN QUEEN -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- 
               ALLNUTT

               He is prostrate beside the engine in early morning sunlight. 
               Except that his eyes are closed, he looks as if he had been 
               dead for about a day.

               o.s., the HARSH SCRAPING of broken glass against wood and 
               the happy shouts of early birds; also the quiet gurgling of 
               river water.

               For a few seconds, these sounds don't even register. Then 
               they reach into him and he winces profoundly. (NOTE: Suddenly 
               and painfully exaggerate all SOUNDS.) His dry mouth works a 
               little. His eyelids twitch. The eyes open -- and shut fast; 
               light is painful to him.

               o.s., the SOUND of a small avalanche of broken glass being 
               thrown overside and hitting the water.

               Rose's hand reaches down past the far side of his head and 
               picks up an empty bottle and an almost empty bottle, and 
               withdraws from SHOT. Allnutt registers vague awareness that 
               someone is near, but doesn't open his eyes.

               o.s., again painfully exaggerated, the SOUND of the gin case 
               being DRAGGED along the deck. His eyes still shut, Allnutt 
               suffers intense pain. He opens his eyes, squeezes them tight 
               shut (which hurts him badly), opens them again, and gazes up 
               past CAMERA in listless, uncomprehending horror.

               ROSE -- (FROM HIS VIEWPOINT)

               She is in painfully bright, early sunlight, and she is wearing 
               white. She has lifted the bottles and the case to the bench 
               beside her. She kneels on the bench, aloof to the CAMERA. 
               She tosses the empty bottle astern. She is on the verge of 
               disposing of the gin in the nearly-empty bottle; on second 
               thought she sniffs at it with mistrustful curiosity; her 
               reaction indicates disgust with the smell, with Drink, and 
               with Allnutt. She turns the bottle upsidedown and lets the 
               contents pour overside into the river, and tosses the bottle 
               contemptuously astern.

               ALLNUTT -- (SAME ANGLE AS BEFORE) -- A LITTLE CLOSER

               His eyes are bloodshot and are swimming with tears induced 
               by the light. He doesn't quite take in what he sees.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a whimpering moan, 
                              pure misery; not for 
                              what he sees)
                         Oh... Oh...!

               Allnutt shuts his eyes. o.s., the GLUG-GLUG-GLUGGING of a 
               full bottle. He looks again. He begins to comprehend and 
               what he sees is, to him, terrible and almost unbelievable.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (with deeper feeling 
                              but quietly; reacting 
                              now to what he sees)
                         Oh...!

               o.s., the SOUND of another flung bottle hitting the water, 
               and of another being opened. Allnutt, using all his strength, 
               manages to lift his head from the floor. The effort is so 
               exhausting and the pain so excruciating that he just lets it 
               fall; the bang is even more agonizing. He licks his dry lips 
               with his dry tongue and tries speaking.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (in a voice like a 
                              crow)
                         Miss.

               ROSE -- (FROM HIS VIEWPOINT)

               She is emptying gin and pays him no attention.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Miss?

               She pays him no attention except to turn the inverted bottle 
               to absolute verticle.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE) -- A LITTLE CLOSER

                                     ALLNUT
                         Have pity, Miss!
                              (pause; SOUND of "glug-
                              glug" o.s.)
                         Miss?
                              ("glug-glug")
                         Oh, Miss, you don't know what you're 
                         doin'... I'll perish without a hair 
                         o' the dog.

               SOUND, o.s., of bottle hitting water.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (continuing)
                         Ain't your property, Miss.

               SOUND, o.s., of a new bottle being opened. CAMERA CREEPS 
               CLOSER on Allnutt, whose eyes become those of a man in hell 
               who knows, now, that his sentence is official, and permanent. 
               With terrible effort, he lifts his head and shoulders.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (NEUTRAL ANGLE) -- NORMAL 
               EXPOSURE

               She is emptying gin. She hears the SOUNDS of Allnutt's moving 
               o.s. Her hard face hardens still more. She glances towards 
               him, continuing to pour.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER VIEWPOINT)

               He is with great pain and effort getting himself to his knees 
               and his arms onto the side bench. It may seem for a moment 
               that he is going to try to come at Rose and make a struggle 
               for it, but no: he now gets his knees to the bench and hangs 
               his body far out over the gunwale and drinks ravenously of 
               the muddy water. He overhangs so far that he is in clear 
               danger of falling in.

               ROSE -- (SAME ANGLE AS BEFORE) -- A LITTLE CLOSER

               She is watching him. SOUNDS, o.s., of the gin emptying, and 
               of his drinking. She is aware he may fall in and she doesn't 
               care.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               He finishes drinking and tremulously pulls himself back, and 
               turns, and collapses into a sitting position on the bench.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She is opening another bottle and casually watching him, and 
               as casually looking away. She is pitiless, vengeful, 
               contemptuous, and disgusted.

               ALLNUTT -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- (NEUTRAL ANGLE)

               His head hangs between his knees; his hands hang ape-like 
               beside his ankles. After a little he is able to lift his 
               head. He props his temples between his hands and his elbows 
               on his knees. He is so weak that one elbow slips, letting 
               his head fall with a nasty jolt and a whimper of anguish. He 
               sets himself more carefully solid and gazes ahead of him at 
               the floor.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh...!

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She ignores him completely; she lays the flap back from some 
               canned meat.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               He gets out and fumblingly lights a cigarette; his hands are 
               shaky. He takes a deep drag and it gives him a dreadful fit 
               of coughing. He glances toward her piteously.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She is slicing bread; she ignores him. His coughing is loud, 
               o.s.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               Recovered from his spasms, he timidly tries a lighter drag. 
               This time he can taste it. It tastes foul. He puts it out, 
               carefully, for later use, takes one look at it, and 
               disconsolately tosses it overside. He looks again towards 
               Rose. He looks away again. He sighs deeply and buries his 
               face in his hands.

               o.s., their SOUND abnormally sharp, the birds are singing 
               like mad.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE -- (MID-AFTERNOON)

               She is sitting on a side-bench in the shade of the awning, 
               calmly reading her Bible. She is in a clean white dress, 
               exactly like the one she wore yesterday. Not a hair is out 
               of place in her tight hair-do. Her bare feet are crossed 
               demurely at the ankles. She sits up straight. She looks very 
               cool, considering the weather.

               PULL BACK, bringing in her day's work: up past her left, 
               pinned to the edge of the awning, hang her newly-laundered 
               dress and undergarments, full of sunlight. There are a few 
               ineradicable streaks of grease in the dress. On the bench to 
               her right, her sewing-basket and some evidently finished 
               sewing chores.

               o.s., the steady GURGLING of river water among the treeroots 
               of the bank; the nervous SCRAPING of a razor.

               FORMAL SHOT -- THE ENGINE

               It looks much cleaner than ever before. (Same SOUNDS o.s.) 
               The CAMERA IS RISING as the SHOT OPENS. It soon brings in 
               Allnutt's head, past the engine, very hot-looking in strong 
               sunlight. He is shaving.

               SLOW PANNING DETAIL. A welter of wet footprints and splashed, 
               soapy deck, Allnutt's clean bare heels glistening high in 
               the SHOT as he stands shaving. CAMERA TILTS and brings in a 
               drowned sliver of soap. Allnutt's filthy clothes, a wet and 
               arrestingly filthy towel.

               Same SOUNDS o.s., razor-scraping a little UP.

               Past the back of Allnutt's head on his close reflection in a 
               small mirror, hung from a funnel-stay; past that, Rose.

               Allnutt is shaving; Rose, in b.g., is reading. It is painful 
               to take off as much beard as Allnutt has been carrying, and 
               he is not a man who takes pain easily; but he does his best 
               to keep his reactions private, and by now he is nearly 
               through. He is whistling softly against his teeth, and 
               frowning at his reflected work with the concentration of a 
               surgeon. He knows, however, that he is visible to Rose, and 
               unwisely keeps glancing towards her (she never looks up once); 
               thanks to this, he lets the razor slip.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Ow... cut myself.

               He glances sharply at Rose to see if she has taken any notice. 
               She does not glance up. Allnutt resents this bitterly. He 
               finishes shaving, and strokes his smooth cheeks with 
               satisfaction. Rose turns a page. With a Rembrandt's patience 
               and concern, he perfects, with his comb, the ideal coiffure, 
               with an artistic quiff along the forehead. His eyes go vain. 
               He treats himself, in reflection, to his idea of what the 
               Lord of Creation should look like. Then he glances towards 
               Rose, who keeps on reading. His look is aloof, miles above 
               her.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               SOUND o.s., of Allnutt's entrance past the engine. She does 
               not glance up, but her eyelids flicker.

               ALLNUTT -- (PAST ROSE)

               He walks a couple of steps towards her in the brilliant 
               sunlight, swaggering a little. Then he stands still, the 
               Stag at Eve, looking at her with a certain high contempt. He 
               is obviously challenging response and recognition. He gets 
               none.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (after a pause; 
                              scornfully)
                         Huh!

               He walks in under the shade of the awning and into

               MEDIUM CLOSE UP -- (CAMERA SWINGING PAST AND OPPOSITE ROSE)

               As he sits down. After another silence, he decides on a new 
               approach. He arranges his face to express high good humor.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (brightly)
                         Well, Miss, 'ere we are, everything 
                         ship-shape, like they say.

               PULL AWAY to TWO SHOT of Rose and Allnutt, as he awaits her 
               reaction. No answer.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (continuing)
                         Great thing to 'ave a lyedy aboard, 
                         with clean 'abits. Sets me a good 
                         example. A man alone, 'e gets to 
                         livin' like a bloomin' 'og.
                              (no answer)
                         Then, too, with me, it's always -- 
                         put things orf. Never do todye wot 
                         ya can put orf till tomorrer.
                              (he chuckles and looks 
                              at her, expecting 
                              her to smile. Not a 
                              glimmer from Rose)
                         But you: business afore pleasure, 
                         every time. Do yer pers'nal laundry, 
                         make yerself spic an' span, get all 
                         the mendin' out o' the way, an' then, 
                         an' hone-ly then, set down to a nice 
                         quiet hour with the Good-Book.
                              (he watches for 
                              something; she 
                              registers nothing)
                         I tell you, it's a model for me, 
                         like. An inspiration. I ain't got 
                         that ole engine so clean in years; 
                         inside an' out, Miss. Just look at 
                         'er, Miss! She practically sparkles.
                              (Rose evidently does 
                              not hear him)
                         Myself, too. Guess you ain't never 
                         'ad a look at me without whiskers 
                         an' all cleaned up, 'ave you, Miss?
                              (no look)
                         Freshens you up, too; if I only 'ad 
                         clean clothes, like you.
                              (huh-uh)
                         Now you: why you could be at 'igh 
                         tea.
                              (no recognition from 
                              Rose)
                         'Ow 'bout some tea, Miss, come to 
                         think of it? Don't you stir; I'll 
                         get it ready.

               Rose does not stir. Allnutt is running low. A little silence, 
               now. He watches her read.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (continuing)
                         'Ow's the book, Miss?
                              (no answer)
                         Not that I ain't read it, some -- 
                         that is to say, me ole lyedy read me 
                         stories out of it.
                              (no answer; pause)
                         'Ow 'bout readin' it out loud, eh, 
                         Miss?
                              (silence)
                         I'd like to 'ave a little spiritual 
                         comfort m'self.
                              (silence; he flares 
                              up)
                         An' you call yerself a Christian!
                              (silence)
                         You 'ear me, Miss.
                              (silence)
                         Don't yer?
                              (silence; a bright 
                              cruel idea. Louder, 
                              leaning to her)
                         Don't yer?
                              (silence. Suddenly, 
                              at the top of his 
                              lungs)
                         HUH??

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               In spite of herself she flinches; but swiftly controls it.

               LONG SHOT -- FROM OTHER SIDE OF THE RIVER

               A half mile of hot, empty water, then jungle, silent on a 
               dream of heat. On the far side the tiny boat and the two 
               infinitesimal passengers.

               After two seconds, Allnutt's "HUH?" is heard.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               In her face are victory, cruelty, and tremendous secret 
               gratification: a Jocasta digesting her young.

               The ECHO comes. Over it --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               A second, further echo comes, and dies.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (yelling)
                         Heyy!!

               Watchful, listening, he walks out of SHOT; CAMERA LOWERS to 
               Rose, whose quiet, pitiless eyes -- wholly unamused -- follow 
               him secretly. The ECHO returns to her; she resumes reading.

               TWO SHOT -- FAVORING ALLNUTT (PAST ROSE)

               He wanders all over the boat, CAMERA ALWAYS CENTERING him, 
               always shifting past the statue-like reader. He barks like a 
               dog; he yowls like a tomcat; he roars like a lion; he bleats 
               like a goat; he crows like a rooster. Finally he sickens of 
               it and walks back past her to his old seat at right angles 
               to her.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               as he sits. Clearly now he is going to try silent decorum, 
               in imitation of her. He crosses his ankles in imitation, and 
               settles his hands in his lap, and even holds his head primly, 
               watching her. But something itches him under the arm and he 
               scratches -- first covertly and insufficiently, then to his 
               heart's content. His exertions have worked up quite a sweat; 
               the midges of late afternoon convene enthusiastically about 
               his head. He looks bitterly towards Rose.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               There isn't a bug near her. Taking her time, she finishes 
               the last page and, not hurrying, but without pause, starts 
               right in on Genesis.

               SWING CAMERA, losing Rose, bringing Allnutt into CLOSEUP. He 
               hates her and the Good Book.

               PULL AWAY into TWO SHOT -- of Rose and Allnutt. After a few 
               moments of silent, motionless tableau, Allnutt hating, Rose 
               reading, he speaks.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Feller takes a drop too much once in 
                         a while. T's only yoomin nyture.

                                     ROSE
                              (remotely)
                         Nature, Mr. Allnutt, is what we are 
                         put into this world to rise above.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Miss, I'm sorry. I 'pologize. There. 
                         What more can a man do than say he's 
                         sorry. Eh?
                              (no answer)
                         You done paid me back, Miss. Didn't 
                         even leave me a drop.
                              (no answer)
                         Come on, Miss. 'Ave a 'eart, can't 
                         ya? Fair's fair.
                              (no answer)
                         Miss, I don't care wot ya say, long 
                         's you say somepin.
                              (no answer)
                         I'll be honest with ya, Miss: I just 
                         can't stand no more of it. I ain't 
                         used to it, that's all.

               A pause.

                                     ROSE
                         So you think it was your nasty 
                         drunkenness I mind.

               A foolish, helpless gesture from Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (bewildered)
                         Well -- wot else?

                                     ROSE
                         You lied to me.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (with earnest dignity)
                         Lied? Oh no, Miss. Lyin's one thing 
                         I don't never do. Not unless there's 
                         no way out.

                                     ROSE
                         You promised we'd go down the river.

               He is so honestly flabbergasted, this brings him up on his 
               feet, goggling at her. When he can find words:

                                     ALLNUT
                         Why, Miss! Is that wot it's all about?

                                     ROSE
                         Of course.

               He draws a deep breath and sits down closer to her than 
               before. He begins quietly, with great patience and 
               reasonableness.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Now for the last time, Miss. Just 
                         try and listen, won't you? Try to 
                         understand.
                              (Rose looks at him 
                              coldly; her jaw is 
                              set)
                         It's sure death a dozen times over 
                         down this river. I 'ate to disappoint 
                         you, Miss. But don't blyme me. Blyme 
                         the river.

                                     ROSE
                         You promised.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (shouting)
                         Well, I'm takin' my promise back!

               He gets up and strides away, CAMERA CENTERING HIM, and walks 
               past the engine.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               She watches after him. She is not a hundred per cent sure of 
               victory; only ninety-five or so.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT -- (DAWN)

               He is asleep on his box of high explosives. o.s., SOUNDS of 
               early birds -- and of Rose's bustling, and of a strong breeze, 
               and of leaves. Presently he stirs, groans and opens his eyes. 
               After a moment he glances in her direction.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               She is readying the fire for tea.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               After a little, Allnutt gives up. He creakily, painfully 
               rises from his bed and gets up into:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- FROM OUTSIDE THE BOAT -- (ON LINE WITH ENGINE 
               AMIDSHIPS)

               He walks towards CAMERA into CLOSE UP and passes engine, 
               CAMERA SWINGING INTO TWO SHOT of Rose and Allnutt.

               Rose is thrusting a saucepan of water into the crackling 
               furnace. Allnutt pauses shyly.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a pitiful effort to 
                              sound casual, and 
                              dignified)
                         G'mornin', Miss.

               Rose straightens up and doesn't even see him, and turns and 
               walks away, CAMERA on her, losing Allnutt.

               She sits on the stern bench and gets out bread and one mug 
               and a can, and starts opening the can. He does not exist.

               After a few seconds, he walks into the SHOT, BACK-TO, and 
               sits down on a right-angle bench, a few feet away from her.

               She continues opening the can. He lights a cigarette from 
               the open tin; it is damp and swollen from the night air, 
               lights slowly, and tastes poorly, but he tries to make the 
               best of it.

               o.s., the SOUND of hot water joins that of the crackling 
               fire. Rose gets up with a cloth for the hot handle and walks 
               up past Allnutt into CLOSE UP and OUT OF SHOT.

               SOUNDS, o.s., of her getting out the water and shutting the 
               door. Allnutt's eyes follow her, wretchedly, wherever she 
               goes.

               She reenters the SHOT, BACK-TO, and returns to her place, 
               still ignoring Allnutt, and starts fixing tea for herself.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT -- NEUTRAL ANGLE

               He is watching her; the last of his staying-power is 
               dissolving.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE -- (FROM HIS VIEWPOINT)

               She is stirring her tea and now she drinks some.

               ALLNUTT -- CLOSE SHOT -- (NEUTRAL ANGLE)

               He is watching her and thorough despair is in his eyes, and 
               unconsciously his head begins to shake a little.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               Now she is eating bread and canned meat.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               He stops shaking his head and just looks.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (quietly)
                         All right, Miss. You win.

               CLOSER SHOT -- ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She meets his eyes, immediately, but says nothing.

               ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER ANGLE)

                                     ALLNUT
                              (accepting utter defeat)
                         Down the river we go.

               He turns to the engine.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ROSE
                              (quietly)
                         Have some breakfast, Mr. Allnutt.

               He is so moved by this line that he is on the verge of tears.

                                     ROSE
                         Or, no. Get up steam. Breakfast can 
                         wait.

               He reacts with the quiet hopelessness of a slave; one beaten 
               look at her, gets to his feet and walks towards CAMERA and 
               engine, filling SCREEN.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               SHOOTING FORWARD ALONG PORT SIDE OF BOAT -- (ABOUT NINE IN 
               THE MORNING)

               The boat is going along at full speed. Boat fills most of 
               r.s., a downstream vista of the river, and the bank, l.s. 
               The breeze is strong now; two-foot waves; clear sunlight. A 
               calmly exhilarating NOISE of water and, o.s., strong, the 
               SOUND of the engine.

               STRAIGHT ACROSS THE BOAT -- ON ALLNUTT

               He is sitting on the starboard bench, back to the sun, 
               transferring canned meat to bread.

               The floor of the SHOT is a high stack of firewood. The left 
               wall of the SHOT is the engine.

                                     ROSE
                              (o.s., calling 
                              something not fully 
                              distinguishable, as)
                         Which bank is Shona on?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (shouting; leaning 
                              his ear towards her)
                         'Ow's that?

               ROSE -- FROM SAME POSITION OF CAMERA -- (DIFFERENT ANGLE)

               She is at the tiller but in spite of cross-bucking the waves 
               she now has the casualness of experience. Except for much 
               more difficult steering, she doesn't have to think much about 
               it now. Her hair is done up, but has blown part free. Her 
               dress is flecked with the dampness of blowing water.

                                     ROSE
                              (shouting)
                         Which bank is Shona on?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (loudly, o.s.)
                         Left. On a hill.

                                     ROSE
                              (shouting)
                         Good. The sun will be in their eyes.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (o.s.)
                         Huh?

                                     ROSE
                              (louder, gesturing)
                         The sun. Will be in their eyes.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               It is becoming more real to him now. He glances towards her. 
               He sets his breakfast aside, gets up, and goes past the engine 
               into the bow section.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               Her eyes strain curiously after him.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (IN THE BOW SECTION)

               He walks in among the boxes of blasting gelatine, his face 
               troubled, and looks down at them.

               THE BOXES -- (FROM AN ANGLE OPPOSING THAT OF HIS EYES)

               They are disposed irregularly in the sunlight; their red 
               lines look sinister.

               MEDIUM CLOSE UP SHOT -- ON ALLNUTT

               as, with face still more troubled, he bends over and lifts a 
               box.

               REVERSE ANGLE -- ALLNUTT -- (SIDE TO CAMERA)

               The prow and river beyond him; he is stacking the boxes along 
               the port bow. He has stuck a rug between them and the hull. 
               Now he stacks the last box and covers it with a rug. He stands 
               and looks at the rug a moment, rather helplessly, then turns 
               to CAMERA and into MEDIUM SHOT; his face is still more badly 
               worried. He glances back towards Rose. He stoops and drags 
               the heavy cylinders into the starboard bow, trimming ship. 
               He walks back towards the engine, mopping his forehead.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She is watching him curiously.

               ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER ANGLE)

               as he comes past the engine, he meets her eye, and looks 
               away. He goes towards his bench and breakfast.

               ALLNUTT -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               as he sits down. He glances towards his gauges and resumes 
               eating. But his appetite is not so good now.

                                     ROSE
                              (o.s., not quite 
                              distinguishably)
                         Don't worry, Mr. Allnutt.

                                     ALLNUT
                         If a bullet hits them boxes, there'll 
                         be no time to worry.

               Taking his knife to use it eating, he suddenly goes still 
               and wary with a new idea. He glances secretly at the knife, 
               and secretly towards the engine.

               INSERT: A PIECE OF ROTTED RUBBER HOSE, PART OF THE WATER 
               LINE.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               His face gets still darker with guile. With a clumsy imitation 
               of concern for the engine, he gets up and walks out of the 
               SHOT, the open knife in his hand filling the SCREEN.

               TWO SHOT -- PAST ENGINE -- FAVORING ALLNUTT (CLOSE)

               ROSE STANDING IN BACKGROUND. As he pretends to tinker with 
               the engine below SHOT, his eyes flicker towards the hose and 
               the knife and think, obviously, of danger and of Rose, of 
               whom he is painfully aware.

               It is clear by his eyes and face that he is trying desperately 
               to make up his mind to cut the hose; and delays because he 
               so dreads the consequences with Rose, who is watching him 
               with mild curiosity. The decision is taken out of his hands.

               Past him, Rose looks with interest ahead, off the port bow.

                                     ROSE
                              (shouting and pointing)
                         Mr. Allnutt!

               She shifts course sharp to starboard. Allnutt hears her and 
               looks around and sees her pointing, and quickly turns and 
               looks ahead and to port. Great fear comes into his face, but 
               also some excitement unrelated to fear.

               LONG SHOT -- PAST ALLNUTT AND THE ENGINE

               As a curve opens, the walled hill-town of Shona is disclosed. 
               Above one building of corrugated iron, a German flag flies.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               Besides the fear and excitement in his face, indecisiveness 
               reaches the point of agony. Past him, the right bank of the 
               river approaches, moving more and more swiftly.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               She is near the bank. She straightens her course.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               He glances desperately toward the rubber hosing.

               INSERT: RUBBER HOSING.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               He glances desperately towards Shona. Shona is swinging wide 
               into view. People are seen, including two men apparently in 
               uniform. Allnutt glances desperately towards his knife.

               INSERT: He closes the knife and slips it into his pocket.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               His face is committed helplessly to catastrophe. He turns 
               his head to call to Rose.

               REVERSE ANGLE -- MEDIUM CLOSE -- ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                              (over his shoulder, 
                              as he crouches)
                         Keep as low as ya can, Miss.

               ROSE -- (FROM HIS ANGLE)

               She nods, and crouches below the benches, her hand still 
               high to steer.

               INSERT: THE RUBBER HOSE.

               as it bursts; a strong spume of water.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               eyes to SOUND.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               eyes to SOUND.

               INSERT: The WATER GAUGE slowly drops.

               ALLNUTT -- ANOTHER CLOSE UP

               as with frantic speed he gets tape and a piece of flat rubber 
               out of his toolbox.

               INSERT: RUBBER HOSE, as Allnutt claps the rubber to the burst 
               hose and starts taping; water still escapes abundantly.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM ANGLE OF HOSE INSERT)

               His desperate face as he works.

               INSERT: The PRESSURE GAUGE, sinking.

               INSERT: The WATER GAUGE, still lower.

               o.s., the engine SOUND slows and fades to a lugubrious 
               CLANKING, then stops altogether.

               From here on, very quiet but in all shots on the boat, 
               steadily LOUDER, a faint RUMBLING ROAR, o.s., the rapids.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE

               anxious and much interested, but no fear.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (o.s.)
                         Just turn 'er loose, Miss. Let 'er 
                         drift.

               Rose looks uncomprehending.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (FROM HER ANGLE)

               He is hard at work. There are no pencils of steam any more.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (over shoulder; bawling 
                              desperately in the 
                              silence)
                         Let 'er drift! All we can do!

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She nods. She releases the tiller. o.s., the SOUND of a 
               bullet; followed, seconds later, by the REPORT of a rifle. 
               Rose looks towards Shona and towards Allnutt.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               He is working. Water is still splattering.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (over shoulder)
                         'Cross our bows, I reckon. Didn't 
                         'it us any'ow.

               He ducks still lower to his work.

               LONG SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               and its occupants, through field glasses, from high bank. 
               Even so, they are small, on the far side of the river.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (o.s. in German)
                         But why didn't they put in?

                                     2ND OFFICER
                              (o.s. in German)
                         Probably they're making for the lower 
                         landing.

               ACROSS THIS:

                                                                    CUT TO:

               LONG SHOT (NOT THROUGH GLASSES) -- LOWER LANDING

               Deep in l.s., the lower landing, which is small.

               High in r.s., The African Queen.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- 1ST AND 2ND OFFICERS AND SWAHILI TROOPS

               on hard, bare ground, corrugated iron building, and German 
               flag, and a portion of the town, in b.g.

               1st Officer is a moderately stupid German. 2nd Officer is a 
               moderately intelligent German. The Swahilis, in their whites, 
               with their elderly Martini rifles, are all eyes and teeth 
               and excitement -- and eagerness to use their weapons.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         Fire twice more across their bows.

               2nd Officer raises rifle, with telescopic sight.

               LONG SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN -- (THROUGH CROSS-HAIRED SIGHT)

               raked from stern to stem.

                                     2ND OFFICER
                              (o.s. in German)
                         She is adrift.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (o.s. in German)
                         Fire.

               The shot moves ahead of the boat. A little kick in the SHOT 
               as the rifle fires; SOUND o. s. The boat advances into the 
               SHOT.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (o.s. in German)
                         Again.

               The shot again leads the boat safely. Some kick, SOUND o. 
               s., and advance of boat as before.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE OFFICERS AND THE NATIVES

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         She's not turning.

               LONG SHOT -- THE BOAT

               is opposite the lower landing, still at far shore.

                                     2ND OFFICER
                              (o.s. in German)
                         She can't. She is adrift.

               OFFICERS AND MEN -- (AS BEFORE)

               1st OFFICER She could anchor.

               2nd Officer has no answer for that.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (quietly, to Swahili 
                              corporal, in Swahili)
                         Order your men to fire.

               The corporal clicks heels and salutes with enthusiasm, and 
               about face, to his men.

                                     CORPORAL
                              (happily and bossily, 
                              in Swahili or in 
                              Swahili-esque German)
                         Fire!

               The boys are all eagerness and delight. They hurry forward 
               into:

               A TRUCKED FRIEZE OF MEDIUM CLOSE UPS

               Some fall prone to fire as they have been trained; others 
               stand; several squat where they take aim. It is clear by 
               their handling of their weapons that they are all farcically 
               lousy shots.

               A SHOT ALONG THEIR RAGGED LINE --

               some prone, some standing.

                                     CORPORAL
                              (with a sweeping 
                              gesture)
                         Fire!

               They fire a ragged volley, rifles at all sorts of angles.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (PAST ROSE)

               Allnutt is still hard at work. The boat is moving faster, 
               near the bank. There is a peculiar multiple NOISE in the 
               air, like bees in a violent hurry, accompanied by the SOUND 
               of tearing paper.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (crouching still lower 
                              at his work)
                         They got us!

               ROSE -- (FROM HIS ANGLE)

               curious about the sound. Now comes the straggling REPORTS OF 
               RIFLES; a volley echoing back from cliff to cliff.

               INSERT: Allnutt completes his taping.

               ALLNUTT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE)

               stepping away.

                                     ROSE
                              (o.s.)
                         Finished?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes -- if we can get up steam in 
                         time, an' the boiler'll stand that 
                         much cold water, an' the mend holds.

               He puts on a lot of wood, and he gets the pump going, 
               cautiously. There is a dangerous straining and CRACKLING 
               SOUND from the boiler as the cold water rushes in. Across 
               it, there is another BUZZING of bullets. Some speckle the 
               water; some hit the heightening rock cliff above and past 
               the boat; the reports arrive and ECHO.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (continuing; he has 
                              been cringing and 
                              mute during the 
                              buzzing; he speaks 
                              across the reports)
                         If only we don't drift into the back 
                         eddy.

               ROSE -- (AS BEFORE)

               She nods. She is watching anxiously, helplessly.

               ALONG STARBOARD -- (SHOOTING FORWARD FROM HER ANGLE)

               The fast current in which they drift, and the slow back-eddy, 
               and their dividing line, are visible. SWING SHOT to CENTER 
               along axis of boat and on Allnutt. o.s., there is the SOUND 
               of a much faster bullet, and suddenly, causing Allnutt to 
               leap like a stricken faun, the whole boat RINGS like a harp.

               INSERT -- THE WIRE FUNNEL-STAY

               on portside has parted, close above the gunwale. It hangs 
               loose by the funnel.

               ALLNUTT -- MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT

               noting and reacting. He turns to Rose, CAMERA SWINGING into 
               TWO SHOT. She has noticed it too, but is not particularly 
               frightened. o.s., there is a METALLIC SMACK. They glance up 
               sharply.

               DETAIL SHOT -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE) -- A HOLE

               high in the funnel.

               DETAIL SHOT -- (FROM ROSE'S ANGLE) -- ANOTHER HOLE

               on the far side of the funnel.

               INSERT: WATER GAUGE, rising.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               checking gauges, working hard.

               INSERT: PRESSURE GAUGE, rising.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               crouching. He adjusts pump to let more water in. The straining 
               SOUNDS intensify. He opens the furnace door.

               LONG SHOT -- THE BOAT (THROUGH TELESCOPIC SIGHT)

               o.s., the rifle FIRES; the shot kicks.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               as a bullet WHINES past overhead. o.s., the furnace door 
               CLANKS SHUT and there is an increased SOUND of fire. She 
               looks reprimandingly towards the bank. We can scarcely see 
               the figures of the officers and men. The rifle REPORT comes 
               through.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE OFFICERS AND MEN

               The men are sheepish and downcast in b.g. The 1st Officer, 
               who fired, lowers his rifle. The 2nd Officer has field 
               glasses. They look at each other. The 1st Officer shrugs.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         Give it to me.

               He takes the rifle and takes careful aim.

               LONG SHOT -- THE BOAT -- (THROUGH THE TELESCOPIC SIGHT)

               He is leading Allnutt just a trifle, and leisurely trying to 
               perfect his aim. While he takes his time, the boat crosses 
               the path of the full glare of the sun. He mutters some German 
               expletive under his breath, and FIRES into blind glare.

               DETAIL SHOT -- GELATINE BOXES

               A corner of one of the gelatine boxes flies apart in 
               splinters.

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- THE TWO OFFICERS

               as the 1st Officer lowers the rifle, his eye hurt by glare, 
               he hands it back to the other.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         Fire at random.

                                     CORPORAL
                         Everybody shoot.

               Everybody happily starts shooting at random. The natives 
               love it.

               FULL SHOT -- ALONG THE FULL LENGTH OF THE BOAT -- ON ALLNUTT -- 
               PAST ROSE Ahead, the escarpment looms, the right bank narrows, 
               a deep shadow between them. The ROAR is by now almost 
               deafening.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (shouting as loud as 
                              he can)
                         Man the tiller now -- we'll try.

               She doesn't understand; she does nothing. He gestures -- the 
               manipulation of a tiller. Rose takes it.

               The SINGING of the bullets is all but inaudible, but three 
               hit the boat. Allnutt starts the engine. It stammers and 
               gulps and dies. The boat swings with great speed into deep, 
               cool shadow as he tries again. It stammers and catches, and 
               dies.

               SHOT PAST ALLNUTT -- AND THE PROW

               The water is terribly swift, but not yet stony; but within a 
               hundred yards ahead there is a terrific cataract.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT -- (PAST HIM, ROSE)

               There is terrific tension in his face, but he is much too 
               busy to be frightened. Rose's face is a sharpening image of 
               her face among the easier rapids. Now that they have come 
               within close, high stone banks, the ROAR is prodigious.

               Allnutt, below SCENE, is working on the engine.

               THE CATARACT -- (FROM HIS ANGLE)

               twice as near.

               ALLNUTT -- (AS BEFORE)

               The engine catches and rises, just AUDIBLE ABOVE the ROAR OF 
               WATER.

               CATARACT -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE)

               They swallow ten of the last twenty yards before the cataract.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               standing, looking intensely ahead, hand firm on tiller.

               THE BOAT -- (FROM ALLNUTT'S ANGLE)

               as it enters upon the cataract.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               as he drops onto his bench next the engine.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Our Father Who art in Heaven...

               The African Queen bucks like a bronco. The air is full of 
               spray and of the ROAR of rushing water. Allnutt serves the 
               engine with panic in his soul. Out of the tail of his eye, 
               he glimpses rocks flashing past.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               She rides the mad tide like a Valkyrie, weaving a safe course 
               through the clustering dangers.

               There comes a place where the river widens and the sweep of 
               the current takes The African Queen over to the opposite 
               bank, as if she were no more than a chip of wood. Rose tugs 
               at the tiller with all her strength. The bows come around. 
               It looks for a space as if the stern would be flung against 
               the rocks. The boat just manages to hold her way.

               Then a backwash catches her, flinging her out again into 
               midstream, so that Rose has to force the tiller across with 
               lightning swiftness. Hardly are they straight again when the 
               banks close in upon them and Rose must instantly pick out a 
               fresh course, through the rocks that stud the surface in 
               flurries of white foam.

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               plunging down a narrow ribbon of water between vertical faces 
               of rock.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               as he waves at the engine and shouts something that is drowned 
               out by the ROAR of the waters.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               She shakes her head and her lips form the words: "I can't 
               hear."

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               gesticulating frantically. He moves forward into a CLOSE UP 
               and shouts:

                                     ALLNUT
                              (shouting)
                         Need fuel! We got to get fuel!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               She nods, to show her understanding of their plight.

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               There is a natural dam ahead, only broken in the center, and 
               there the water piles up and tumbles over in a vast green 
               hump. The launch puts her nose and heaves up her stern as 
               she hits the piled-up water; then she shoots down the slope, 
               landing with a crash on the high green waves beneath the 
               waterfall.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN -- (SHOOTING PAST ROSE)

               Green water comes boiling over the port deck and into the 
               boat. Allnutt must hold onto the engine to keep from being 
               swept off his feet. It seems as though The African Queen is 
               doomed to put her nose deeper and deeper into the torrent 
               until she will submerge entirely -- but at the last possible 
               moment she shakes herself loose and comes clear.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               as she throws her weight on the tiller

                                     ROSE
                              (shouting)
                         Stop the engine!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               as he obeys dazedly.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               The maneuver was nicely calculated; the launch's momentum 
               carries her through the edge of the eddy into the slack water 
               under the lip of the dam. She comes up against this natural 
               pier with hardly a bump, and instantly a trembling Allnutt 
               is fastening painters to rocks.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Whew!!!

               FULL SHOT -- ROSE

               as she starts to rise, but finding herself weak in the knees, 
               sits back momentarily. Despite an empty feeling in her stomach 
               and a pounding heart, she wears a smile of satisfaction.

               She looks around. They are moored in what must be one of the 
               loveliest corners of Africa. There are numerous shelves on 
               the high banks bearing flowering plants which trail shimmering 
               wreaths down over the rocks. A beam of sunlight reaches over 
               the edge of the gorge and turns its spray into a dancing 
               shadow. The NOISE of the fall is not deafening, but rather a 
               pleasant musical accompaniment to the joyful SINGING of the 
               river.

                                     ROSE
                         How lovely!

               Allnutt enters the SHOT from BEHIND CAMERA. She turns her 
               smile on briefly. then raises her eyes again to the hanging 
               gardens above.

                                     ROSE
                              (continuing)
                         Lovely, isn't it.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (following her gaze)
                         It is at that.
                              (he laughs suddenly)
                         We sure pulled it off, didn't we, 
                         Miss? Sucked the Germans in proper. 
                         They were so surprised to see the 
                         ole African Queen -- they didn't 
                         think of shootin' at us till we were 
                         almost past. They didn't believe 
                         anybody'd try to get down these 
                         gorges. Didn't believe nobody could. 
                         Well, we showed 'em, didn't we?
                              (Rose nods)
                         Not that I'd like to do it every day 
                         of the week. We took on enough water 
                         to sink anything else that floats. 
                         He reaches for the pump and goes to 
                         work.

                                     ROSE
                              (coming out of her 
                              reverie)
                         Here -- let me do that.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (protesting)
                         Oh, no, Miss.

                                     ROSE
                         Please let me.

                                     ALLNUT
                         All right -- but don't wear yourself 
                         out... I'll pick up some wood.

               Rose applies herself to the pump. It takes her a little while 
               to get into the right rhythm, and when she does, even so 
               small a thing as this brings a thrill of achievement.

                                     ROSE
                         I hardly know what happened after 
                         Shona. Everything's a jumble. I have 
                         no idea how far we've come or whether 
                         it's morning or afternoon or --

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

               as Allnutt gathers wood on the bank.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I guess you were too busy, Miss, to 
                         pay attention to anything but what 
                         you were doing.

                                     ROSE
                              (hesitantly)
                         Did I -- do all right?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (with deep feeling)
                         Better'n all right, Miss...

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               Her face flushes with pride.

               PAN SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               as he goes back onto the boat carrying an armload of wood. 
               He is limping a little. He lets the wood fall by the engine, 
               then sits down and begins to unlace his canvas shoe.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Picked up a thorn on the bank, I 
                         guess. Went right through the rubber 
                         sole.

                                     ROSE
                         Let me.

               On her knees, she slips the shoe off; she takes his slender, 
               rather appealing foot into her hands. She finds the place of 
               entry of the thorn and presses it with her finger-tips while 
               Allnutt twitches and jumps with absurd ticklishness.

                                     ROSE
                         No, there's nothing there now.

               She lets his foot go.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Thank you, Miss.

               He lingers on the bench, gazing up at the flowers, while 
               Rose lingers on her knees at his feet.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a certain awe in his 
                              tone)
                         It is pretty at that.

               Rose looks up at his face. There is something appealing, 
               almost childlike about the little man as he looks wonderingly 
               around. Her expression grows tender; she would like to pet 
               him. He looks down at her. She averts her eyes.

                                     ALLNUT
                         It reminds me -- that waterfall does -- 
                         of --

               Allnutt never tells what it reminds him of. He puts out his 
               hand toward Rose. She catches it -- to hold it, not to put 
               it away. Allnutt comes down to his knees and they are in 
               each other's arms.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               LONG SHOT -- AFRICAN QUEEN -- (EARLY MORNING)

               as a few slanting rays of the sun strike her funnel. Vapors 
               still cling to the surface of the river. Over the SOUND of 
               the waterfall, comes the tuneful SINGING of a bird. Presently 
               Rose's figure is revealed moving about.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE

               as she pours tea into two cups, and moves with them toward 
               the stern, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER as she crosses to the 
               sleeping Allnutt. CAMERA MOVES into CLOSE TWO SHOT as she 
               kneels beside Allnutt and puts one tea-cup down close to his 
               outstretched hand.

                                     ROSE
                              (softly)
                         Mr. Allnutt. I mean -- dear.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (opening his eyes)
                         Well now -- blimey! This is more 
                         like it.

               Breakfast in bed.

                                     ROSE
                         Two spoonfuls of sugar is right, 
                         isn't it?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (nods)
                         Fancy your building the fire and all -- 
                         while I slept.

               Rose regards him tenderly for a long moment; then, with a 
               birdlike movement, she kisses him on the cheek. Allnutt puts 
               his arms around her.

                                     ROSE
                         Dear -- there's something I simply 
                         must know.

                                     ALLNUT
                         What's that?

                                     ROSE
                              (after a blushing 
                              interval)
                         What's your first name?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Charlie.

                                     ROSE
                              (to herself like a 
                              schoolgirl)
                         Charlie... Charlie... Charlie...

                                     ALLNUT
                         Give us another kiss.

                                     ROSE
                              (her arms around him, 
                              kissing him)
                         Charlie! Charlie dear...

               They hold each other for a while. Then she slips out of his 
               arms, hands him his cup and they begin stirring their tea. 
               Rose looks at the beauty all around them.

                                     ROSE
                              (her eyes suddenly 
                              wet)
                         This must be one of the loveliest 
                         places in all Africa.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I've been around a bit and I must 
                         say I never seen no place to compare 
                         with it in the whole world. Kinda 
                         hate to leave it.
                              (hastily, as though 
                              he fears being 
                              misunderstood)
                         Not that I ain't all for goin' on, 
                         Y'unnerstand.
                              (she gives his hand a 
                              squeeze)
                         Do you spose that last big cataract 
                         coulda been Ulanga Falls? As I 
                         remember the map, it was just a little 
                         way down from Shona. And if it was 
                         Ulanga, there ain't no more big 
                         cataracts between us an' the lake.

                                     ROSE
                         How much farther is the lake, Charlie?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh -- 'bout two 'undred miles.

               They are quiet a moment. Abruptly, Rose gets final, and 
               energetic -- swallows the last of her tea in that manner and 
               stands up, a touching blend of spinsterish edginess and 
               blossoming female softness.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, I suppose it's time we were on 
                         our way.

               FULL SHOT -- DECK OF BOAT

               Rose takes her place at the tiller and Allnutt goes forward 
               in unquestioning obedience. He is boss of the family, but 
               she is boss of the boat and the voyage. He casts off, and 
               starts up the engine. Again The African Queen is under way.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               at the tiller. She looks back, drinking in the place with 
               her eyes. She wants never to forget a single detail. Allnutt 
               enters the SCENE -- puts his arm around her, and stands 
               looking back at the loveliest place in the world.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- AFT -- PAST THEM

               We see the waterfall and the flowers withdraw. The SOUND of 
               the waterfall still dominates -- a SOUND of serene, 
               inexhaustible vitality like that of their bloodstream.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (in a broken voice)
                         Give us another kiss, old girl.

               They kiss, as the boat is swept into motion.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               The river is smooth, swift and fairly straight. The launch 
               passes some hippos bathing in the shallows. The deep, swift-
               running channel carries her to within a few yards of the 
               great beasts.

               Allnutt and Rose shout at them and wave their arms. The hippos 
               squeal like pigs. Allnutt imitates the SOUND, a feat which 
               Rose finds to be funny beyond words. She laughs until it is 
               painful and she has to hold her side. Allnutt laughs too, 
               between squeals, hugely delighted with the success of his 
               imitation. Just as Rose is about able to control her laughter, 
               he squeals once again, which sends her off into fresh peals 
               of mirth.

                                     ROSE
                         Stop, Charlie -- stop it!

               Their laughter begins to die down, then starts up again. 
               Finally comes a moment of silence while they struggle to 
               regain breath, and during that moment Allnutt hears a SOUND 
               which is not at all funny.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie, listen... You 'ear wot I 'ear?

               OVER the SOUND of the engine, comes a distant ROAR.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I guess that wasn't Ulanga Falls, 
                         after all.

                                     ROSE
                              (soberly)
                         I guess not.

               Allnutt applies himself to the boiler, putting more wood in, 
               adjusting the draft.

               The speed of the river increases, as does the DIN of the 
               approaching cataract. The African Queen begins to heave among 
               the first waves of the race.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               staring forward as she braces herself once more to hold the 
               tiller steady.

               LONG SHOT -- THE RIVER AHEAD -- (FROM ROSE'S VIEW)

               as the waterfall comes into view, Allnutt in f.g.

               He throws her a swift, backward look.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               scared, but game.

                                     ROSE
                              (calls)
                         Goodbye, Charlie.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               shouting an answer; his voice is lost in the UPROAR.

               FULL SHOT (MOVING) -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               as she rears up and hangs for a moment at the crest of the 
               waterfall. Then she shoots forward and down, finally to crash 
               in a tangle of currents below the waterfall. She shakes with 
               the impact. Water flies back, high over the top of the funnel, 
               then she surges on.

               There is a TEARING SOUND beneath, followed by a horrid 
               vibration which seems as if it will shake the boat to pieces.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                              (screams)
                         Keep her going, Charlie!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               opening the throttle. The devastating vibration increases.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               as she fights to keep the boat in mid-current, but something 
               is wrong with the steering.

                                     ROSE
                              (screams)
                         Charlie!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               He points toward the bank where a big rock juts out into the 
               river.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               fighting the tiller. The boat swings around crabwise toward 
               the rock, and it looks for a moment as though the stern will 
               surely crash into it. Rose keeps the tiller hard over. Sure 
               enough, The African Queen comes all the way about, her bows 
               to the shore, grounded; but the maneuver is not completely 
               successful. Instantly she heels and rolls. A mass of water 
               comes boiling in over the gunwale. The boiler fire is 
               extinguished and a wild flurry of steam pours out.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               Grabbing a painter, he leaps like an athlete into the whirling 
               eddy, gets his shoulder under the bows and heaves.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE BOAT

               The bows slide off and the boat rights herself, wallowing, 
               three-quarters full of water. Instantly the current pulls 
               her downstream.

               CAMERA PANS as Allnutt leaps up the face of the rock, 
               clutching the painter. He gives it a turn around an angle of 
               the rock and braces himself. His shoulder-joints crack as 
               the rope tightens, but slowly the boat swings in to shore. 
               Five seconds later, she is safe, and Allnutt is making painter 
               after painter fast to the shore.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               standing on the bench in the stern, the water slopping at 
               her feet. She manages a smile at Allnutt. She feels a little 
               sick and faint now that it is all over.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               He sits down on a rock and grins back at her.

                                     ALLNUT
                         We nearly done it that time, didn't 
                         we, Rosie.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               as she sits on the gunwale. She doesn't wish to let her 
               weakness be seen. She forces herself to be matter of fact.

                                     ROSE
                         I wonder how much we've lost.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                         Let's get this water out and see.

               He swings himself aboard, splashes down to the waist and 
               fishes about for the pails.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               as she tucks her skirt up into her underclothes as though 
               she were a little girl at the seaside. CAMERA PANS with her 
               to Allnutt. She takes a pail and the two of them go to 
               bailing, and conversation ceases with the effort.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               MEDIUM CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT -- (SHOOTING DOWN OVER ROSE'S 
               SHOULDER)

               He has gotten up a couple of floor boards in the waist, and 
               is down on his knees inspecting the planking.

                                     ALLNUT
                         It's better than we coulda hoped 
                         for. We 'aven't lost nothin', far as 
                         I can see. 'Aven't damaged 'er skin 
                         worth mentionin'. I shoulda thought 
                         there'd been an 'ole in 'er 
                         somewheres, after wot she's been 
                         through.

                                     ROSE
                         What was all that clattering just 
                         before we stopped?

                                     ALLNUT
                         We still got to find that out, old 
                         girl.

                                     ROSE
                         How are we going to do that, dear?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I'll 'ave to go underneath and 'ave 
                         a look.

               He is out of his shirt and trousers in a jiffy. His drawers 
               are the old-fashioned kind reaching to the knee and tying up 
               with a string behind. He picks up a rope and ties one end 
               around his middle and gives the other end to Rose.

                                     ALLNUT
                         There ain't no other way. You stay 
                         'andy with that rope -- case there's 
                         a fancy current down at the bottom... 
                         'Ere goes!

               And over the side he goes. His feet remain in view for a 
               moment; then, kicking, they disappear.

               UNDERWATER SHOT -- THE PROPELLER SHAFT OF THE LAUNCH

               Allnutt swims into the picture, giving forth with bubbles. 
               He inspects the shaft.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               leaning far over the stern, trying to glimpse what is 
               happening beneath The African Queen. Presently, Allnutt's 
               head breaks the surface of the water.

                                     ROSE
                              (hovering anxiously

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

               With her help, he climbs back aboard, sits down on the bench. 
               Rose sits beside him and waits for him to regain his breath. 
               She puts out her dry hand and clasps his wet one.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (dully)
                         Shaft's bent to blazes like a 
                         corkscrew, and there's a blade gone 
                         off the prop.

                                     ROSE
                         We'll have to mend it, then.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Mend it!
                              (he laughs bitterly)
                         Not likely.

                                     ROSE
                         Why is that, dear?
                              (he doesn't answer)
                         What shall we have to do before we 
                         go on?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I'll tell ya.
                              (savage despondency 
                              in his tone)
                         I'll tell ya what we could do if we 
                         was sittin' in the landin' slip at 
                         Limbasi. We could pull this old tub 
                         out an' take the shaft down an' 'aul 
                         it over to the workshop where they'd 
                         forge it straight again. An' then we 
                         could write to the makers and get a 
                         new prop. They might 'ave one in 
                         stock 'cause this boat ain't over 
                         thirty years old. An' while we was 
                         waitin' we might clean 'er bottom 
                         an' paint 'er. Then we could put in 
                         the shaft an' the new prop an' launch 
                         'er an' go on as if nothin' 'ad 
                         'appened. -- But this ain't Limbasi, 
                         an' so we can't.

                                     ROSE
                              (after a pause)
                         Can't you get the shaft out without 
                         pulling the boat on shore?

                                     ALLNUT

                         underwater. Could do it perhaps.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, if you were able to get the 
                         shaft up on shore, could you 
                         straighten it?

                         Ain't got no hearth. Ain't got no 
                         anvil. Ain't got no coal. Ain't got 
                         nothin'. An' furthermore, I ain't no 
                         blacksmith.

                              (tapping her memory)
                         I saw a Masai native working once. 
                         Using charcoal... on a big hollow 
                         stone. He had a boy to fan the 
                         charcoal.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes, I've seen that, too! But I'd 
                         use a bellows, myself -- make them 
                         easy enough.

                                     ROSE
                         Well, if you think that would be 
                         better.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (the engineer in him 
                              taking over)
                         There's 'eaps an' 'eaps of driftwood 
                         up on the bank.

                                     ROSE
                         Why don't you try it?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (suddenly shying)
                         No. It ain't no use, Rosie, old girl. 
                         I was forgettin' that prop. There's 
                         a blade gone.

                                     ROSE
                         Can't we go on the blades that are 
                         left?

                                     ALLNUT
                         There's a torque. Prop wouldn't be 
                         balanced. Wouldn't take five minutes 
                         for the shaft to be like a corkscrew 
                         again.

                         We'll have to make another blade. 
                         There's lots of iron and stuff you 
                         could use.

                              (ironically)
                         And tie it on, I suppose.

                                     ROSE
                              (missing his irony)
                         Yes, if you think that will do. But 
                         wouldn't it be better to -- weld it? 
                         That's the right word, isn't it? 
                         Weld it on?

                                     ALLNUT
                         You're a one, Rosie. Really you are.
                              (laughs)

                                     ROSE
                         Isn't weld the right word, dear? You 
                         know what I mean even if it isn't, 
                         don't you?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh, it's the right word, all right.

               He laughs again. At first, Rose is afraid that his laugh is 
               caused by desperation, but when she sees that it is not, she 
               laughs with him.

               Directly they are in each other's arms, kissing as two people 
               might be expected to kiss on the second day of their 
               honeymoon.

               working on the shaft. Now and then he bangs his hammer on 
               the hull of the boat. Apparently he and Rose have a system 
               of signals. Just as he succeeds in loosening the bracket 
               supporting the shaft, a whim of the river expresses itself 
               in a fierce underwater swirl. Allnutt is turned upside down, 
               but he holds onto the bracket like grim death.

               pulling in on the rope. Allnutt comes to the surface, drops

               She begins to peel off her clothes.

               CLOSE SHOT -- UNDERWATER -- THE SHAFT

               Allnutt swims into view, slides the shaft out through the 
               bearings and begins to carry it toward shore. The current 
               catches him. He loses his footing, regains it, only to fall 
               again. The heavy shaft is too much for one man to handle.

               He is struggling vainly with it when into the SCENE swims 
               Rose. She takes one end of the shaft, Allnutt the other, and 
               together they walk under water toward shore

               Rose is working the bellows while Allnutt hammers patiently. 
               Presently he lays aside the hammer and, using a taut string, 
               judges the straightness of the shaft. Apparently he is pleased 
               with his work, for he grins at Rose and nods briefly.

               turning. SOUND of the engine, o.s. CAMERA TILTS UP. Allnutt 
               is leaning over the stern, watching. In the b.g. stands Rose, 
               with her hand on the throttle.

                                     ALLNUT
                         It turns right enough. But that don't 
                         prove nothin' much. Will it stand up 
                         under a full head of steam, that's 
                         the question. We'll get our answer 
                         out there -- and Lord 'elp us if it 
                         ain't the right one.

                                     ROSE
                         Let's find out right now.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Why not?

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               Rose comes back and takes the tiller in hand. Allnutt casts 
               off the moorings. As the bows come out into the current, he 
               gently opens the throttle.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                         Goodbye, darling.

               He bends over the engine.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

                                     ROSE
                         Goodbye, darling.

               Neither she nor Allnutt hears the other; neither is meant 
               to; there is a high courage in them both.

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               CAMERA PANS with boat as she surges out into the stream. She 
               spins around as her bows come into the river, and Rose puts 
               the tiller across. Next moment she is flying down the stream 
               once more.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               EXTERIOR -- THE RIVER -- LONG SHOT

               In the foreground, a spray of jungle foliage in sharp and 
               exotic contrast to the upland pines of the last sequence. 
               The African Queen comes into view, and CAMERA PANS with her. 
               A flock of ibis in the path of The African Queen rise on 
               great snowy wings, only to settle again when she has passed.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

               looking about them.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, we done it, old girl. We got 
                         down the rapids all right. I didn't 
                         think it could be done. If it 'adn't 
                         been for you, sweetheart, we shouldn't 
                         be 'ere now. Don't you feel proud of 
                         yourself, dear?

                                     ROSE
                              (indignantly)
                         No, of course not. Look at the way 
                         you made the engine go. Look how you 
                         mended the propeller. It wasn't me 
                         at all.
                              (with even greater 
                              emphasis)
                         I don't think there's another man 
                         alive who could have done it.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (wryly)
                         I don't think anyone's likely to 
                         try.

               LONG SHOT (MOVING) -- A TURN IN THE RIVER

               Her waters widen and a dreary, marshy, amphibious world is 
               revealed; tree trunks and little creeper-entangled islands 
               take the place of the foaming rocks of the upper river.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

                                     ALLNUT
                         Looks like this old river got tired 
                         of all that runnin' an' jumpin' she 
                         did an' decided to lay down an' rest 
                         for a while... 'Ow about our doin' 
                         the same, Rosie -- seein' as 'ow the 
                         sun's goin' down.

               Rose nods. She edges The African Queen in towards the shore. 
               Allnutt gets his boat hook into the stump of a large tree 
               which, still half alive, grows precariously on the edge of 
               the water with half its roots exposed.

               Rose goes to the boiler and starts making tea, while Allnutt 
               gets a line around a root. There is hardly any current. The 
               light is fading.

                                     ALLNUT
                         It must be right 'bout 'ere the river 
                         changes her nyme from Ulanga to Bora.
                              (he slaps at a mosquito)
                         Not that it matters. Nobody lives 
                         between 'ere and the lake. Unless 
                         you call monkeys people.

               He slaps again. There is the high frequency SOUND of 
               mosquitoes which fill the air.

                                     ROSE
                              (slapping)
                         How much farther do you think it is 
                         to the lake?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh -- not so many miles, but --

               He slaps his arms and legs, get up and stands and makes swift 
               passes in the air, as though shadow-boxing.

                                     ROSE
                              (slapping)
                         But what, Charlie?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (a note of hysteria 
                              in his voice)
                         I got a feelin' that before long 
                         we'll wish we was shootin' the rapids 
                         again... Ow!... Ow!

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               It is nightfall and the mosquitoes have left their homes in 
               the mud, under leaves, on stalks of reeds, to hunt flesh and 
               blood. They close in on Rose and Allnutt; they bite through 
               clothes -- they crawl under clothes; some of the smallest 
               creep into nostrils and under eyelids. Rose and Allnutt are 
               used to ordinary attacks, but this is beyond all experience. 
               They slap ever more wildly; they begin to show panic.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh!

                                     ALLNUT
                         This is awful!

                                     ROSE
                              (pulling at her dress)
                         I'm going in! I'm going to get under 
                         the water!

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes! That's it!

               But looking past Rose toward the river, he sees something 
               that makes him grab her wrist.

                                     ALLNUT
                         No!

                                     ROSE
                         But I'm being eaten alive!

                                     ALLNUT
                              (pointing)
                         Look.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- LARGE CROCODILE

               on the bank.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (o.s.)
                         What'd you say 'bout bein' eaten 
                         alive?

               And now we see that it is not one crocodile but several 
               submerged and partially submerged. Two slide into the water 
               from the bank.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               After their first start at the sight of the crocs, they go 
               back to fighting the cloud of mosquitoes that, hungry for 
               blood, fill the air with their WHINING.

                                     ROSE
                         Get me out of here, Charlie! I'm 
                         going mad!

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               Allnutt runs to the engine, tries to start it.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Ain't no steam. Can't start engine.

                                     ROSE
                              (wails)
                         I can't stand it, Charlie!

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Ere! Lay down! Get under the canvas 
                         there! I'll get us out into the 
                         channel.

               She obeys. Allnutt casts off, and seizing a deckboard begins 
               to paddle. The space between the launch and the bank slowly 
               widens till at last they are in the channel. Rose peeps out 
               from under the canvas.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Right, Rosie. We got away from 'em. 
                         You can come out.

                                     ROSE
                              (crawling out)
                         I'm ashamed, Charlie, acting like 
                         that -- but I couldn't help it. I 
                         was going mad.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Me, too.

                                     ROSE
                         You're so bitten!

               Even in the faded light, his face and body show innumerable 
               bumps.

                                     ALLNUT
                         The bites themselves ain't so bad; 
                         it's 'avin' them all round you. I've 
                         'eard of them sendin' buffaloes an' 
                         native cattle stark starin' mad -- 
                         an' they run an' run till they fall 
                         dead.

                                     ROSE
                              (after a pause)
                         What are we going to do, Charlie?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Now you're asking!

                                     ROSE
                         Will they be like that wherever we 
                         tie up?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Can't say.

                                     ROSE
                         We can't just drift all night.

                                     ALLNUT
                         If the river keeps straight an' deep 
                         an' slow, there ain't nothin' much 
                         can 'urt us -- I know! I'll let the 
                         anchor out a ways. She'll stop us 
                         before trouble gets too near.

               He lets the anchor chain out, then sits on the bench. Rose 
               leans against him. He puts his arm around her.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (after a long silence)
                         What a time, Rosie -- what a time! 
                         We'll never lack for stories to tell 
                         our grandchildren -- if we live to 
                         'ave any.

               The launch seems to be floating in space, solitary as any 
               one of the stars that are now beginning to shine and twinkle 
               overhead.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               EXT. DELTA -- DAWN

               The river ends in a five-mile-wide pool, fringed all the way 
               round with reeds. These reeds extend as far as the eye can 
               see.

               The boat comes down into the pool, nosing along the edge, 
               looking for an opening. Allnutt and Rose are talking as she 
               steers and he feeds the furnace.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Look -- maybe that's a channel.
                              (it isn't)
                         No.

               A herd of hippopotami suddenly surface and scatter. Plunging 
               through water, mud and reeds just ahead of the boat. Behind 
               them is left a faint indication of a channel.

                                     ROSE
                         What about there?
                              (pointing)
                         That looks like a way through.

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               showing a very doubtful passage into the reed bed.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Could be.
                              (worried)
                         I dunno.
                              (pause)
                         Once we get in, an' these 'ere reeds 
                         close up be'ind our stern -- we'd 
                         never get back, you know, Rosie.

                                     ROSE
                         We can't stay going round and round 
                         out here.

                                     ALLNUT
                         If anything goes wrong a few 'undred 
                         feet in there, we're 'eld in a trap, 
                         you know -- till we starve or go orf 
                         our 'eads. I dunno!
                              (loudly. decisively)
                         All right. Put 'er over.

               Rose swings the tiller and the boat charges at the little 
               opening in the reeds.

               FULL SHOT -- REEDS

               looking from outside. We see the boat nose into the opening. 
               In front of her the reeds part. Others are pressed under 
               water. But as soon as her full length is inside, the reeds 
               she has parted or submerged close together again, or rise 
               slowly from under water. As they close, they form an 
               increasingly solid barrier behind her wide stern. Very soon 
               The African Queen is completely hidden from us except for 
               the top of her tall funnel, which moves more and more slowly 
               as she goes on into the reed bed.

               EXT. REED BED

               seen from a few feet above. A view of the endless miles of 
               papyrus reed. At one place we see the top of the funnel of 
               The African Queen.

               EXT. -- THE LAUNCH

               the engine choking and gasping, shaking the launch. CAMERA 
               PANS DOWN TO:

               CLOSE -- BOW OF LAUNCH

               pushing ineffectually against the knotted roots of the reeds, 
               which have piled up under it. There is almost no water -- 
               just the tangled roots and an inch of liquid mud.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ALLNUTT

               shutting off steam. The corners of his mouth tighten. He is 
               badly frightened. He tries to keep the fear out of his voice 
               as he tells Rose; but we can see that Rose is desperately 
               scared too.

                                     ALLNUT
                         It's the propeller, I think. It won't 
                         work in this mud.

               Allnutt looks down over stern. He gets up.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Where's the boat-'ook?

               ANOTHER ANGLE

               Allnutt finding boat hook and moving forward.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Maybe we can pull 'er along.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- BOWS OF LAUNCH

               Allnutt reaching forward with boat hook, hooking it into 
               strong clumps of reeds, pulling desperately. The clumps 
               resist; it seems as if the boat is about to move. Then the 
               clumps give way.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE

               amidships, watching Allnutt.

                                     ROSE
                         Here! Wait a minute!

               She finds a long pole or plank, chooses a good spot and begins 
               to push. After a couple of ineffectual attempts, Allnutt 
               hooks an especially strong clump at the same time as Rose 
               finds a solid spot against which to push.

               The boat heaves and shakes, and, with a final heart-breaking 
               effort on the part of Rose and Allnutt, it moves forward a 
               couple of feet.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               gasping for breath, hope flickering up again.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Come on -- again!

               As they resume their efforts, CAMERA DRAWS BACK, RISING TO

               FULL SHOT -- REED BED

               from twenty feet above. We see the funnel of the launch 
               inching slowly and painfully through the reeds.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN

               in the reeds. Rose and Allnutt are poling with their boat 
               hooks. Even through the masks of mud they are wearing, we 
               can see that they are both terribly haggard and exhausted.

                                     ALLNUT
                         We've come along under steam, and we 
                         paddled an' pushed 'an' pulled the 
                         ole boat along with the 'ook. Wot we 
                         ain't done yet is get out an' carry 
                         'er. I spose that'll come next.

                                     ROSE
                         Hard to breathe! -- the air is so 
                         wet and heavy.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Can't 'ardly tell water from land -- 
                         or for that matter, day from night.

                                     ROSE
                         The whole thing is like a fever dream, 
                         isn't it?

                                     ALLNUT
                         All the channels we've lost -- an' 
                         the twistin' we've done -- we may 
                         come back out where we started -- if 
                         we come out at all.

                                     ROSE
                         We've always followed the current, 
                         dear -- what little there is.

                                     ALLNUT
                         That don't mean nothin' -- with this 
                         river. This river's crazy. Crazy as 
                         I am!

                                     ROSE
                              (gently)
                         Charlie.
                              (she touches him)
                         We must try to keep hold of ourselves.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Sorry, old girl.

               Allnutt starts pushing all the more energetically on his 
               pole.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Best thing to put the roses back in 
                         our cheeks is to get out o' these 
                         reeds.

               Allnutt's exertions carry them into the shallows. The boat 
               touches bottom. Not all of their strivings with the boathooks 
               serve to move it an inch further.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (finally)
                         What I said a while back about 'avin' 
                         to carry the boat was meant for a 
                         joke -- but as it turns out, I wasn't 
                         jokin'.

               Taking the painter, he goes over the side and starts pulling 
               like a draft animal. Slowly, ever so slowly, the boat begins 
               to move, until at last she is floating again.

               Rose helps him back in. Suddenly she gives a cry of horrified 
               surprise.

                                     ALLNUT
                         What's the matter?

               Rose can only point. As he sees what it is, Allnutt's face 
               contorts with panic and disgust. He makes a kind of growl of 
               horrified surprise, across which:

               DETAIL SHOT -- ALLNUTT'S ARM, CHEST OR BELLY

               A couple of leeches hang to him, visibly swelling with his 
               blood.

               QUICK PULL AWAY TO TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- Over his 
               line; we see 20 or 30 leeches on him.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Augh, the little beggars --
                              (a cracking voice)
                         Pull 'em off me, Rosie -- no, the 
                         heads stay -- poison yer blood.

                                     ROSE
                              (sudden remembrance)
                         Salt!

               She rushes to get their tin box of it.

               EXTREME CLOSE UP -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               eyes on what she is doing below SCREEN.

               DETAIL -- DAMP SALT

               applied to a leech. It flinches, elongates, bunches and 
               swells, and drops off.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               She dabs salt on the last two or three, while he stands like 
               a partly calmed, still shocked horse.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Anythin' I hate in this world it's 
                         leeches -- filthy devils.

               He stands trembling quietly, the triangular bites still bleed 
               freely. Rose dabs tenderly at one of the sinister little 
               wounds.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- AT BOWS (SHOOTING FORWARD 
               FROM STERN)

               They hook the boat with great effort slowly along. The hull 
               grazes something. They work still harder. There is a rumbling 
               SCRAPE. Then, also, a sludgy GRINDING.

               With the grinding, Allnutt moans as if in his sleep and tries 
               desperately to reverse direction.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (gasping)
                         Back! 'Old 'er back --

                                     ROSE
                              (imitating him)
                         Mud?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes.

               There is too much momentum for them.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (reversing his dragging)
                         Let's try an' get 'er over it, then. 
                         Give 'er all you got, Rosie.

               They strain enough to half kill them; the sludgy grinding 
               intensifies.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (gasping)
                         Good girl -- we're still makin' 
                         'eadway -- All you got now --

               Abruptly the boat comes to a dead stop.

                                                                  DISSOLVE:

               VERTICAL SHOT -- THE MOTIONLESS GUNWALE AND MANGROVES

               and the just perceptibly moving slime on the water between.

               ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               They sit by each other, she holding his forehead; he is in a 
               dry nausea of exhaustion.

                                     ROSE
                         There, there, dear. There, there. 
                         There, dear.

               Able to speak, ashamed, he tries to joke.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Fine specimen of a man I am, ain't 
                         I!

                                     ROSE
                         You're the bravest man that ever 
                         lived.

               He is silent, slowly and rather inanely shaking his head; 
               she watches him.

                                     ROSE
                              (like a very old wife 
                              to a very old husband)
                         Lie down, dear. Rest. Both of us.

               He keeps on shaking his head.

                                     ROSE
                         You just overdo, that's all. You 
                         must take care of yourself! You're 
                         not one bit well.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well! We're both of us half dead.

                                     ROSE
                              (ignoring this)
                         Besides, it's high time we had our 
                         supper. It'll be dark before long.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You 'ave some. I ain't up to it yet.

                                     ROSE
                         Or a nice steaming cup of tea.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You fix yourself some.

                                     ROSE
                         Not just yet, thank you.
                              (she gets up, taking 
                              his hand)
                         Come now.
                              (she helps him weakly 
                              up)
                         Lie-down.

               CAMERA STAYS WITH THEM, MOVING INTO VERTICAL TWO SHOT --

               Rose helps Allnutt to the floor, and nurse-like, puts bunched 
               rags under his head.

                                     ROSE
                         There now. All comfy?

               He tries to smile.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You rest, too.

                                     ROSE
                         Indeed I will.
                              (she lies down beside 
                              him and smiles at 
                              him)
                         That's all we need, a good long rest, 
                         and we'll be on our way in a jiffy. 
                         You'll see.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (managing a smile)
                         Sure.

               She turns her back to him because she can't meet his eyes. 
               Both lie with eyes wide open, obsessed.

                                     ROSE
                              (after a pause)
                         Try to sleep, dear.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (pause)
                         Sure. You too.

                                     ROSE
                         Of course.

               She reaches a hand behind her and pets him. He clearly has, 
               and resists, an impulse to take her hand.

               She withdraws her hand. A pause.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie.

                                     ROSE
                              (pause; with quiet 
                              dread)
                         Yes, Charlie.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You want to know the truth, don't 
                         you?

                                     ROSE
                              (pause; very quietly)
                         I know it.

               His eyes show deep pain.

                                     ROSE
                         We're finished.

                                     ALLNUT
                         That's right.

                                     ROSE
                         Even if we had all our strength we'd 
                         never be able to get her off this 
                         mud.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Not a chance in this world.

               They are silent a while; everything is in their eyes. As 
               suddenly and swiftly as her weakness allows, she turns to 
               him; their faces are close.

               CAMERA DROPS NEARER.

               She looks into his quiet eyes; her own eyes are fiery, not 
               with tears but with passionate, incredulous despair; 
               speechless, trying to speak; a sort of palsy.

                                     ROSE
                         So useless!

               He puts a hand along her cheek. Slowly he realizes, and 
               enhances for us, her only concern with dying.

                                     ALLNUT
                         They don't come no better'n you.

               They lie still, looking at each other.

               Within about 15 seconds, their faces profoundly alter; by 
               changes of makeup, every couple of seconds, the motionless 
               faces become years older, and take on a kind of worn majesty; 
               and gradually lose consciousness; by the end of the seconds, 
               the eyes are closed. The CAMERA meanwhile very slowly 
               withdraws upward. In the last we can clearly see of their 
               faces, they are quite possibly dead. As CAMERA RISES, we see 
               them at full length, as prostrated and flattened as grasses 
               pressed in a book; then, their static boat and the crawling 
               water; the CAMERA RISES among the overhanging mangrove 
               branches which obscure and trap them; and, as it rises, the 
               SCREEN slowly darkens.

               The CAMERA STOPS RISING. The dead silence is broken by an 
               infinitesimal SOUND OF RUSTLING. By eye and ear, after a few 
               seconds, it becomes recognizable as the stillest, slenderest 
               kind of rain, splintering downward, very gradually increasing 
               in volume and in richness of SOUND as the darkness deepens, 
               to an immense, peaceful, steady, flooding downpour. The 
               darkness pales into full daylight and the downpour continues, 
               and through it we can dimly see the boat and the prostrate 
               bodies, and after perhaps ten seconds of the new daylight 
               (after maybe fifteen of darkness), the rain begins to abate 
               and the CAMERA BEGINS VERY SLOWLY TO DESCEND.

               It gets down through the branches. The bodies are motionless; 
               so is the boat; but the slime on the water, though still 
               slow, moves with a distinct new kind of energy.

               THE CAMERA STOPS DESCENDING. A couple of seconds later, the 
               boat stirs, just perceptibly; motionless again; then stirs 
               again, more distinctly.

               At height of PULL UP OF CAMERA and darkening, a quiet rich 
               CRUMPLING OF THUNDER. (Throughout this short sequence all 
               sounds, even those recorded at full blast, are held way down 
               on the track -- as if heard in a dream or in imagination.)

               Across MUTTERING OF THUNDER --

                                                                    CUT TO:

               SHOT -- SKY AND MOUNTAINS

               Low in foreground, a sharp watershed peak; all foliage is 
               fiercely ruffled, showing pale undersides: beyond, a 
               tremendous valley, a dim streak of river through it; beyond 
               that, magnificent peaks: but most of the SCREEN is sky, in 
               which (sped up by SLOW CAMERA) prodigious black and white 
               clouds bloom, explode and wrestle. Over all, a solemn, ominous 
               light. A moment of absolute stillness; then first huge drops 
               of splattering rain; then SCREEN is blinded and deafened 
               with simultaneous THUNDER AND LIGHTNING, over which CAMERA 
               TILTS DOWNWARD along the line of enormous columns of rain 
               which take over SCREEN.

               SHOOTING UPSTREAM, to breadth of a swollen river, in heavy 
               rain:

               PAN DOWNSTREAM, past Mission clearing.

               Possible CUT IN: Mission bungalow screen door flapping and 
               banging in wind; or porch rocking chairs' ghostlike cradling:

               PAN ON DOWNSTREAM flooding water.

               LONG SHOT across roaring river on Shona, PANNING DOWNSTREAM; 
               one tiny figure struggles miserably through mud:

               Possible CUT IN: the drowned German flag, clinging 
               disconsolately to its pole.

               END PAN on water at mouth of rapids; bring up ROAR From high 
               and to one side: where the rapids enter the Basin: (greatly 
               augmented water NOISE.)

               PULL CAMERA DOWN and to right to VERTICAL SHOT over the Rose-
               Allnutt waterfall, much more water than before, plunging 
               into pool; bringing up SOUND sharp.

               TILT CAMERA UP to right, to center on where rapids leave the 
               pool; the whole pool, dark and calm on first trip, is now 
               boiling white. TILT A LITTLE FURTHER and CUT OFF SHORT.

               The rock behind which they sheltered for the welding; it is 
               so over-whelmed with water it is no longer visible; there 
               could be no anchorage here now. QUICK PAN DOWNSTREAM.

               Where the river enters the pre-Delta broadening: the water 
               is markedly slowed, but there is much more movement than 
               when we were here before; TILT UPWARD across a solid floor 
               of calmer, rain-marked water, lighter rain and THUNDER, 
               overcast; SOUND of calm, steady rain on miles of water; the 
               reeds where Rose and Allnutt entered: lighter rain; its SOUND 
               among reeds; the water is distinctly higher on the reeds and 
               broken reeds distinctly move on it; LIFT towards mangroves 
               past reeds.

               Mangroves and shadow; and the infinitesimal splintery 
               whisperings of light rain. TILT CAMERA DOWNWARD and resume 
               the vertical SHOT on which we faded from Rose and Allnutt, 
               and SLOWLY BRING THE CAMERA TOWARDS THEM, through and beyond 
               mangrove tanglings, to MEDIUM CLOSE. The boat shines with 
               wetness and they are drabbled with it. Nothing moves except 
               the slime-flecked water and that moves slowly, but with a 
               new kind of energy. Neither Rose nor Allnutt is conscious.

               At MEDIUM CLOSE, halt CAMERA. A couple of seconds after it 
               stops, there is a first, scarcely discernible shifting motion 
               of the boat. They are still unconscious. Bring up the SMALL 
               SOUNDS OF RUNNING WATER a little; another little shifting of 
               the boat; a little more distinct. They are still unconscious.

               ROSE -- IN EXTREME CLOSE UP

               She looks as if she had cried herself dry, and she looks as 
               if she might quite possibly be dead.

               ALLNUTT -- EXTREME CLOSE UP

               His face is crumpled and distorted against one elbow; in his 
               face, too, there is the look of incredible sadness and defeat; 
               and he, too, could be dead.

               (In both faces, also the epitome of utter weariness and of 
               rest after weariness.)

               DETAIL SHOT -- Allnutt's emaciated hand, motionless, caressing 
               her shoulder, and involved in her hair.

               ANOTHER -- Her own hands, motionless; they are folded -- 
               quite unconsciously -- in her automatic gesture of prayer.

               TILT CAMERA UPWARDS from this -- past gunwale, we see by 
               quiet motion of mangrove roots, that the whole boat is 
               cradling gently in the rain.

               FROM BENEATH BOAT -- DETAIL SHOT -- past bottom of hull, dim 
               daylight opens just discernibly as boat lifts from muck.

               PAST PROW -- ON MANGROVES

               Prow is just perceptibly rising.

               UNDERWATER SHOT -- BENEATH THE KEEL

               a real, gaping light now, visible in motion of boat and of 
               water and of muck-flakes in water.

               PAST PROW -- ON MANGROVES

               The prow really moves forward now.

               ANOTHER SHOT -- PAST PROW (UNDERWATER)

               A new obstruction looms; a thick, dark root; prow (and CAMERA) 
               come right up against it but hit it slowly, a little to one 
               side, and the whole boat, with a hollow SCRAPING, glances 
               along past.

               ACROSS THE GLANCING

                                                                    CUT TO:

               MEDIUM SHOT -- BOAT (FROM DOWNSTREAM)

               silently floating towards CAMERA in rustling rain, pointing 
               slantwise, beginning to straighten.

               ABOARD -- (PAST ROSE AND ALLNUTT)

               who are still unconscious; athwart the boat; the quiet 
               movement past the mangroves.

               THE ENGINE -- (SHOOTING FORWARD FROM STERN)

               The engine approaches a low and dangerous-looking branch; it 
               just clears

               BOAT -- (SHOOTING PAST PROW)

               The boat nears a splitting of waterways. Both look bad, but 
               one looks far worse; prow nudges a mangrove mass and for a 
               few seconds everything is at stalemate; then stern begins to 
               swing forward.

               BOAT STERN

               as it begins to swing forward. It looks as if everything 
               would jam; and with soft bumpings and subdued underwater 
               scrapings and near-misses above water too, the boat does a 
               slow, somnambulistic broken-field crawl during which the 
               light becomes stronger and the rain less, and its SOUND less.

               TWO SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE

               The strengthened lights and shadows move on their faces and 
               their closed eyes. Rose registers nothing. Allnutt's face 
               and his slow, weak, negative hands both convey that he is 
               dreaming something and doesn't believe it. His face goes 
               inert again. There are fewer shadows now, brighter light, 
               and there is a deep quiet scraping SOUND which makes him 
               open his eyes. Still unable to believe what he sees, he turns 
               his face up toward CAMERA.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE MOVING, THINNING OVERHEAD TANGLE OF 
               MANGROVES -- (FROM HIS VIEWPOINT)

               and the sun-touched last of the rain.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (o.s., softly; an 
                              almost incapable 
                              voice)
                         Rose. Rosie.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               He is half-up, hands on her, trying to stroke and pat her 
               awake.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Darling. Dear.

               He takes her head gently between his hands and turns her 
               face up to him.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Look at us, Rosie! My God just look! 
                         We're movin', dear! We're movin'!

               She opens her eyes and looks up. All she sees at first is 
               Allnutt's face, close to her. She looks at it with devotion 
               and with terrible sadness.

                                     ROSE
                         We did our best, dear.

               He grabs her quite roughly into his arms and kisses her 
               several times, rapidly and without passion.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (talking through this)
                         No, look, Rosie, just look at us! 
                         We're movin', don't you see? Movin', 
                         that's what!

               And with this, as we catch her first realization and reaction, 
               we leave the last of the mangroves and are among the reeds, 
               gliding slowly yet freely; with a RUSTLING of reeds against 
               the boat reminiscent of the rustling of the finished rain, 
               and the late afternoon sunlight moving through the reeds as 
               though they were harpstrings, and casting an almost rustling 
               of slender light and shadow across their faces. Her face 
               becomes quietly transcendent. She gets with great difficulty 
               to her feet (she is very weak; so is he) and, reaching over 
               the gunwale, begins grabbing reeds and with what strength 
               she has, tries to help them along. As soon as he realizes, 
               he gets up weakly, too, and hurries and gets the pole, crying:

                                     ALLNUT
                         Easy, Rosie dear! You just rest, old 
                         girl. Easy now.

               Meanwhile, with what strength he has, he is poling.

               Past them and past prow, we see light beyond the high reeds 
               which steadily, slowly part for the prow and sweep past the 
               flanks of the boat.

               ANOTHER ANGLE -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               Both continue working; their incredulous eyes are fixed past 
               the prow. Behind them, reeds partly close back, dark mangroves 
               recede. Their eyes intensify.

               PAST PROW -- FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT

               The last few feet of the reeds part and the boat drifts free 
               and clear onto a horizonless floor of golden light (or if in 
               black and white, a kind of unearthly silver); a low group of 
               wooded islands in the distance.

               TWO SHOT -- MEDIUM CLOSE -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               as they still drift, a soft breeze on them, looking around.

               He sits down, obviously because he feels too weak to stand. 
               Rose, still standing, looks towards him, waiting his authority 
               to believe what she already knows. They speak quietly, as if 
               someone were asleep.

                                     ROSE
                         It -- really is?

               He reaches out his hand to her.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Come on -- sit down, old girl. Yer 
                         tremblin' like a leaf.

               But she gets down quietly onto her knees and bows her head. 
               He looks at her a few moments, then a little uneasily and 
               shyly, gets down onto his knees. She begins to cry very deeply 
               and silently; we don't see her face. Allnutt puts his arm 
               around her, and she hides her face against him and cries, 
               audibly now but quietly, taking his free hand in her own.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (very quietly)
                         There, there, Rosie. There, old girl. 
                         We're all right now, dear. There, 
                         there.

                                     ROSE
                         It's like Heaven.

               By Allnutt's face, it is better than that, but he knows what 
               she means.

                                     ROSE
                              (in a queer voice)
                         God let us live.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Musta been 'Im, all right -- 'tweren't 
                         nothin' in our power.

               A pause.

                                     ROSE
                              (quiet, charged voice)
                         It wasn't for our sakes, either.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (pause; carefully)
                         'Ow you mean, Rosie?

                                     ROSE
                         He brought us here to do His work.

               She gets to her feet and walks past CAMERA towards bow.

               ROSE -- (PAST BOW) as she comes up, Allnutt following. She 
               is looking all around, and past her we see only empty water 
               and empty sky. She begins to look impatient.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (quietly)
                         Rosie, this lake's an 'undred miles 
                         long; forty wide, at the biggest. It 
                         might be days afore she comes our 
                         way.

                                     ROSE
                         Then start the fire. We'll go find 
                         her.

                                     ALLNUT
                         No, Rosie, we won't 'ave to go out 
                         of our way. She'll come to us.

                                     ROSE
                         Come to us?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Patrolin' the lake. She's bound to 
                         come by, don't you never worry. An' 
                         when she does, we want to be well 
                         'id.

                                     ROSE
                         Hmmm. Perhaps you're right.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Sure I am. So let's just cruise about 
                         a bit till we find a good 'idin' 
                         place, an' then we'll lay in wait 
                         fer 'er. Right?

                                     ROSE
                         Right.

               They go back towards engine.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT as, Rose watching almost with 
               reverence, Allnutt strikes a match and touches it to the 
               carefully prepared wood.

               THEY WATCH:

               THE CURLING SMOKE -- (FROM THEIR VIEWPOINT) and catching 
               flame and the SOUNDS -- an image almost of resurrection.

               ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- (FROM FIRE'S ANGLE) their faces 
               revitalizing, as light of flame works on them over increasing 
               SOUND of fire; he gently shuts the furnace door, and adjusts 
               the draft; the fire begins a really happy ROARING. Allnutt 
               looks up and around across the water, clearly figuring where 
               they might cruise around.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (murmuring)
                         Let's -- see. We might, uh --

               His eyes sharpen into great intentness on something very 
               distant.

               All of a sudden he picks up a bailing pail, dips it full, 
               and douses the fire.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE (PAST ALLNUTT) Rose looks at him amazed. He 
               gestures silently with a jerk of his head. She walks towards 
               CAMERA and looks.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LAKE Almost invisibly small on the horizon, 
               a small black smudge, a gleaming white speck, which sharpens 
               like a fresh star as we look.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         That's The Louisa.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT He gets up on the gunwale.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes, that's The Louisa all right.

                                     ROSE
                         Which way are they going?

                                     ALLNUT
                         They're comin' this way.

                                     ROSE
                              (forcing herself to 
                              be calm)
                         They mustn't see us here. Can we get 
                         far enough among the reeds for them 
                         not to see us?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Got to work fast.

               Pulling and tugging with the boat hooks, they swing the launch 
               around and head her into the reeds.

                                     ROSE
                         We'll have to cut some down. How 
                         deep is the mud?

               Knife in hand, Allnutt goes over the bows among the reeds.

               WIDER SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT as he goes over the bows. He 
               sinks in the mud until the surface of the water is up to his 
               armpits. Floundering about, he cuts every reed within reach. 
               Then, pulling on the bow painter, he is able to work the 
               launch up into the cleared space.

                                     ROSE
                         There's still a bit of her sticking 
                         out.

               She throws a desperate glance towards The Louisa, which is 
               making good time, and is less than half the former distance 
               away.

               Allnutt splashes back among the reeds and goes on cutting 
               and hauling. Rose helps him to get back on board. He is in a 
               state of near collapse from his exertions. He lies on the 
               deck panting while Rose cranes her neck over the reeds.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LOUISA

                                     ROSE
                              (o.s.)
                         She's coming right toward us, Charlie!

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT Groaning, Allnutt staggers to 
               his knees, then to his feet. Together they watch the approach 
               of The Louisa.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LOUISA white, spotless, beautiful. At her 
               stern floats the flag of the Imperial German Navy. On her 
               foredeck, we can pick out the six-pound gun which gives the 
               Germans command of the lake. We can see the figures of sailors 
               moving about on the deck.

               Over the SOUND of her engines comes a smartly given order, 
               following which The Louisa alters her course by a point or 
               two.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT Allnutt groans again, this 
               time from relief.

                                     ROSE
                         They're going a different way now.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I thought they'd seen us.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LOUISA heading toward some little islands 
               in the middle of the lake.

               ROSE AND ALLNUTT -- AS BEFORE

                                     ALLNUT
                         They're makin' for them islands to 
                         anchor for the night. They'll go on 
                         in the mornin'. But don't you worry. 
                         They'll come 'ere again. You just 
                         see if they don't. You know 'ow 
                         Germans are; they lays down systems 
                         an' they sticks to 'em. Mondays 
                         they're at one place. Tuesdays 
                         somewheres else. Wednesdays p'raps 
                         they're 'ere. Same ole round, week 
                         after week. You know.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LOUISA as the SOUND of her engines ceases.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Look! Wot did I tell ya! She's 
                         droppin' 'er anchor.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ROSE
                              (nods)
                         How long will it take to get the 
                         torpedoes ready?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I can get the stuff into the tubes 
                         in no time, as you might say. Don't 
                         know 'bout the detonators. Gotta 
                         make them up, you see -- devise 
                         something. Then we got to cut 'oles 
                         in the bows. Might 'ave it all done 
                         in three days. Depends on them 
                         detonators.

               Rose receives this information in silence. Her eyes remain 
               on The Louisa, now lying at anchor.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie, old girl -- Rosie --

                                     ROSE
                              (a faraway note in 
                              her voice)
                         Yes, dear.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I know wot you're thinkin' 'bout 
                         doin'.
                              (he takes her hand 
                              and presses it)
                         You're thinkin' 'bout takin' The 
                         African Queen out at night next time 
                         The Louisa comes 'ere, ain't you, 
                         old girl?
                              (Rose nods)
                         We ought to manage it.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               PAN SHOT -- ALLNUTT'S HAND as it takes one of the packages 
               out of the box and carries it to one of the cylinders and 
               places it inside. A wrench and the cylinder head are in view 
               lying on the deck.

               Allnutt's face comes into the SCREEN. He puts more packages 
               into the cylinder.

               CAMERA PULLS BACK to include Allnutt and Rose in TWO SHOT. 
               Leaning over the side, Rose brings up handfuls of mud from 
               the bottom and dumps it on the deck. Allnutt carries the 
               sticky stuff to the cylinder and drops it in.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               INSERT: A DISC OF WOOD IN ALLUTT'S HAND. Three holes have 
               been punched through it. Allnutt's fingers fit cartridges 
               into them. Then a second disc of the same diameter is placed 
               over the first. The second disc has three nails in it. It is 
               turned so that a nail point rests on the percussion cap of 
               each cartridge.

                                     ALLNUTT'S VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         Ought to work all right.

               He begins to screw the pair of discs together. CAMERA PULLS 
               BACK revealing Rose and Allnutt intent upon his handiwork.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Can't put them into the cylinders 
                         yet. They're a bit tricky. We can 
                         put 'em in when we're all ready to 
                         start.

                                     ROSE
                         It will be dark then, of course. 
                         Will you be able to do it in the 
                         dark?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Case of have to...
                              (he puts the detonators 
                              away in the locker)
                         Better get the cylinders into place 
                         now.

               With Rose's help he drags and pushes one of the cylinders 
               forward.

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE BOW The cylinders in position, projecting 
               like cannon through two holes on either side of the stem 
               just above the waterline. o.s., the SOUND of hammering.

               The CAMERA RAISES and DOLLIES FORWARD TO: CLOSE SHOT -- 
               ALLNUTT -- SHOOTING at him over Rose's shoulder. He is nailing 
               the cylinders solidly into position with battens torn from 
               provision cases. Finally, the work done to his satisfaction, 
               he tosses the hammer aside.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, old girl -- I done it all now. 
                         Everything. We're all ready.

               It is a solemn moment. He shakes his head.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (reminiscently)
                         You know I been thinkin'. There ain't 
                         no need for us both to -- to do it. 
                         Now I've 'ad time to study it, I can 
                         plainly see it's a one-man job.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ROSE
                         You couldn't be more right, Charlie 
                         dear.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Glad you agree, Rosie. When the time 
                         comes I'll put you ashore on the 
                         south side of the lake and you wait 
                         for me while I attend to The Louisa...

                                     ROSE
                              (interrupting)
                         Certainly not! You're the one to be 
                         put ashore.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Me...?

                                     ROSE
                         Of course, you. This whole thing was 
                         my idea, wasn't it?... I'm the logical 
                         one to carry it out.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Why, Rose! I'm surprised! You're a 
                         very sensible woman as a rule. Now 
                         we won't 'ave no more talk along 
                         those lines.

                                     ROSE
                         I can manage this launch every bit 
                         as well as you, Charlie Allnutt, and 
                         you know it!

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie, you're cracked!

                                     ROSE
                         Didn't I steer going down the rapids?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Oh, you steered well enough. But you 
                         don't know nothin' about the engine. 
                         Spose she broke down on you out there 
                         in the middle of the lake? Where 
                         would you be? But me, I'd leave the 
                         tiller and go and do a thing or two 
                         to the engine -- you know, spit on 
                         'er or kick 'er in the belly -- an' 
                         she'd go right to work again. She 
                         knows 'oo 'er boss is, you bet, that 
                         ole engine does.

                                     ROSE
                              (defeated)
                         All right, Charlie. I guess you have 
                         to be there.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, now, that's more like it. I'll 
                         dive off a second or two before the 
                         crash and swim over to where you'll 
                         be waitin' on the north shore.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie...

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes.

                                     ROSE
                         No need of our pretending.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I don't know wot you're talkin' about.

                                     ROSE
                         Oh, yes you do. There's got to be a 
                         hand on that tiller right up to the 
                         last.

               Allnutt would like to protest; he opens his mouth to do so, 
               but no words issue. He falls into a stricken silence.

                                     ROSE
                              (continuing)
                         Don't you understand, dear? I wouldn't 
                         care about going on to Nairobi -- 
                         without you.

               Having no words, Allnutt can only nod.

                                     ROSE
                              (continuing)
                         We'll do it together. It will be you 
                         at the engine and me at the tiller, 
                         as it has been from the start.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (in a choked voice)
                         Right.

                                     ROSE
                         When you come to think of it, we're 
                         a very lucky couple, really.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Aren't we just.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes, dear.

                                     ROSE
                         Let's make The African Queen as clean 
                         as we can. Let's scrub her decks and 
                         polish her brass.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (in quick agreement)
                         I've got a can o' paint for 'er mast. 
                         She ought to look 'er best. 'Er very 
                         best. Representin' as she does the 
                         Royal Navy.

               MEDIUM SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN Quite a transformation has 
               taken place in her appearance. Her decks are clean, her brass 
               polished. Rose is engaged in painting her stumpy mast. Her 
               old boiler shines like a mirror. In fact, Allnutt is using 
               it as such while he shaves.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (between strokes of 
                              the razor)
                         I wish I 'ad somethin' clean to put 
                         on. It don't seem right for the ship's 
                         captain to be without pants.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie...

                                     ALLNUT
                         Yes, dear.

                                     ROSE
                         I have a pair you can wear.

                                     ALLNUT
                         You mean a pair o' yours?

                                     ROSE
                         What's the difference?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well, you're the one'll have to look 
                         at me.

               She gives them to him. Getting into them, Allnutt begins to 
               laugh. When he reveals himself to Rose, it is with obvious 
               embarrassment. He assumes a position rather like September 
               Morn's.

                                     ROSE
                         Here. Put this on, too.
                              (she displays one of 
                              her singlets)

                                     ALLNUT
                         Ain't that goin' a bit too far?

                                     ROSE
                         Don't be silly!

               He takes it and puts it on. He looks intently at Rose, 
               expecting ridicule. Her eyes are not on him; they are on the 
               horizon.

               LONG SHOT -- A PUFF OF SMOKE AND A WHITE DOT The Louisa.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT as she stares at the horizon. 
               His eyes follow hers.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LOUISA

                                                               DISSOLVE TO:

               CLOSE SHOT -- A CYLINDER -- (NIGHT) as Allnutt's hands finish 
               fitting a detonator into its fore-end, tapping around its 
               edges with a hammer. He is in the water. CAMERA PANS with 
               him around the bow to the other cylinder. Rose passes down 
               the second detonator. Allnutt puts it into place and pulls 
               himself up over the side. He goes to the boiler which casts 
               a red glow on the surrounding deck, and inspects the gauge. 
               Steam is up. He looks across the waters of the lake toward 
               the little group of islands.

               LONG SHOT -- THE LOUISA A bundle of faint lights in the 
               distance.

               TWO SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT as a sudden gust of wind strikes 
               the surrounding reeds, causing them to bend and toss. Allnutt 
               takes Rose in his arms. Clinging to one another, they kiss; 
               try to speak; fail -- then separate.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Blowing up a bit. We better get 
                         started. All right?

                                     ROSE
                         All right.

               He unfastens the side painter, then takes the boat hook and 
               thrusts it against a clump of reeds. The African Queen moves 
               slowly out into the fairway. Allnutt lays the boat hook down, 
               feels for the throttle valve and opens it. The propeller 
               begins its beat and the engine its muffled clanking.

               FULL SHOT -- THE AFRICAN QUEEN coming out of the reeds into 
               the lake.

               TWO SHOT -- ALLNUTT AND ROSE Allnutt is staring at the bows, 
               scowling.

                                     ROSE
                              (observes his 
                              expression with 
                              anxiety)
                         Is something the matter, dear?

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Er bows are ridin' awful low for 
                         this kind o' water. Them 'eavy 
                         cylinders are what's doin' it.

               A wave splashes over the bows into the boat, so that her 
               decks swim in water.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Got to get 'er nose way up 'igh or 
                         we'll be in trouble.

               He begins shifting ballast into the stern of the boat, which 
               is swaying and staggering about in haphazard fashion.

                                     ROSE
                         We've been through worse.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rivers is one thing -- open water 
                         another. She ain't built for it. Not 
                         when it's rough.

               He goes to the engine, begins to tinker with it for a moment.

               CLOSE UP -- ROSE

               steering. She is calm, resolute. Allnutt comes back into 
               SHOT. His brows are working.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie.

                                     ROSE
                         Yes, Charlie.

                                     ALLNUT
                         This 'ere storm is messing things up 
                         a bit. 'Er bows 'ave got to ride 
                         'igh or we'll be swamped before we 
                         get 'alf way to The Louisa. On the 
                         other 'and, they've got to be low 
                         when we 'it 'er, so' the explosion 
                         will be down at 'er waterline.

                                     ROSE
                         Can anything be done?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (nodding)
                         Just before we 'it, I'll bring the 
                         ballast back forrard.

                                     ROSE
                         Goodbye, darling.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Goodbye, sweetheart darling...

               A wave breaks over the side, drenching them both.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Blimey!

               FULL SHOT -- THE BOAT

               It rolls extravagantly as a wind of incredible speed whips 
               down on the lake and rouses the shallow waters to maniacal 
               fury. A series of waves come crashing against the flat sides. 
               Then suddenly the darkness is torn away by a dazzling flash 
               of lightning which reveals the wild waters around them. 
               Thunder follows with a loud BANG like a thousand cannon fired 
               at once. Then comes the rain pouring down through the 
               blackness in solid rivers.

               The wind abates momentarily, but the surface of the lake 
               still heaves. The boat begins to pound, raising her bows 
               high out of the water and bringing them down again with a 
               shattering CRASH.

               Allnutt seizes a pail and begins to bail furiously, but to 
               no purpose.

               Now the wind strikes from a new quarter, laying its grip on 
               the torn surface of the lake and building it up into 
               mountains.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE

               numbed and stupefied, but struggling to maintain her hold on 
               the tiller. Suddenly Allnutt is at her side, putting her arm 
               through a life buoy. They totter and sway for a long moment, 
               then the stern of the launch is engulfed by a heavy wave, 
               and they are up to their waists in water. The African Queen 
               is swamped. Very slowly she capsizes. In the distance we see 
               the lights of The Louisa, safe at anchor.

                                                                  FADE OUT:

               FADE IN:

               INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN -- THE LOUISA

               The CAPTAIN and FOUR of the SHIP'S OFFICERS constitute the 
               court in a proceeding against a small man dressed in woman's 
               bloomers and a ragged singlet. The latter stands, chin on 
               his chest, gazing dully at the carpet.

               The CAPTAIN is President of the court, of course. He is a 
               corpulent man with whiskers, groomed in imitation of von 
               Triplitz. Behind him on the wall is a portrait in oils of 
               the Kaiser. He keeps his eyes closed throughout the 
               proceedings.

               To the Captain's right, stands the ship's FIRST OFFICER, who 
               is acting as prosecutor. He is clean-shaven, dark, with pale 
               blue eyes; his manner is rigidly correct. To the Captain's 
               left, sits the ship's SECOND OFFICER, who is serving as 
               defense counsel. He is a sleepy, stupid looking man with a 
               big scar on his cheek. All three members of the court are in 
               snowy ducks with gold buttons, white gloves and decorations.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in broken English)
                         What is your nationality?

               Allnutt does nothing to indicate he hears the question.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         French?... Belgian?... English?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (thickly)
                         English.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         Your name?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Charles Allnutt.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         What were you doing on the island?
                              (Allnutt remains 
                              sullenly silent)

               The punishment for not answering the court is hanging.

                                     ALLNUT
                         All right. 'Ang me. 'Oo cares?

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         What were you doing on the island?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Nothing.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         How did you get there?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Swam.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         Do you know that you are in an area 
                         prohibited to all but members of the 
                         forces of His Imperial Majesty, Kaiser 
                         Wilhelm II?

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Oo cares?

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         What is your rank.

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Ow's that?

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         You are a soldier, are you not?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (disgustedly)
                         Naaa!

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         What are you then?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I ain't nothin'.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         The prisoner is obviously here to 
                         spy on the movements of the K?nigin 
                         Luise.

               The Captain, without opening his eyes, turns to the Second 
               Officer; nods to him to proceed. The latter is completely at 
               a loss. He rises, stammers a few words in German.

                                     2ND OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         No proof of criminal intent --

               He stops, tongue-tied; then throws up his hands in a final 
               gesture, sits heavily and starts wiping his face with a 
               handkerchief.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to Allnutt in English)
                         What were you doing here, if you 
                         were not spying?
                              (Allnutt doesn't answer)
                         The Court sentences you to death by 
                         hanging.
                              (then in German to 
                              the others)
                         Not from the yard arm, but when we 
                         reach port.

               At this moment, there is a bustle outside the tiny crowded 
               cabin. Then the door opens and a colored Petty Officer comes 
               in and salutes them.

                                     PETTY OFFICER
                              (in Swahili)
                         We are about to pick up another one. 
                         A woman.

               The Captain rises and goes to the door.

               LONG SHOT -- ROSE

               FROM HIS VIEWPOINT

               She is sitting on one of the small barren islands, a little 
               way up from the beach; the dinghy manned by native oarsmen 
               with a white officer, is already half way there.

                                     CAPTAIN' VOICE
                              (o.s.)
                         She looks like she's white.

               INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN -- AS BEFORE

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to Allnutt in English)
                         Was there a woman with you?

               Allnutt drops his mask of sullen stupidity and turns quickly 
               to the door, but the Captain's bulk is blocking his view. He 
               tries to push him aside. The First Officer hits Allnutt a 
               hard blow across the face. Allnutt runs to a porthole and 
               looks out in time to see:

               LONG SHOT -- ROSE FROM HIS POINT OF VIEW

               She is struggling with the WHITE OFFICER who is trying to 
               make her enter the boat.

               CLOSE UP -- ALLNUTT

               frantic with excitement.

                                     ALLNUT
                              (calls, shouting)
                         Rosie! Rosie!

               LONG SHOT -- ROSE

               SHE STOPS STRUGGLING,

                                     ROSE
                              (calling back)
                         Charlie!

               INT. CABIN -- AS BEFORE

               The First Officer, who seems to enjoy hitting Allnutt, now 
               delivers a second blow, this time knocking him down. He 
               remains standing over Allnutt while the Captain and Second 
               Officer resume their seats.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to Allnutt)
                         Who is that woman?

                                     ALLNUT
                              (rising unsteadily)
                         I don't know.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         But you just called her by name.

                                     ALLNUT
                         I thought it was somebody else.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (in German)
                         Maybe I'll change my mind and hang 
                         you from the yard arm after all.

               o.s., the SOUND of approaching steps; then Rose, followed by 
               the WHITE OFFICER, enters the cabin. She stands staring at 
               Allnutt for a long time.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie dear!

                                     ALLNUT
                         'Ello, Rosie.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Aha! You do know her!

                                     ALLNUT
                         I calls all the girls Rosie.

               The WHITE OFFICER swings into view a life buoy on which is 
               printed "The African Queen".

                                     WHITE OFFICER
                              (in German)
                         She had this with her.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (to Rose, in English)
                         Who are you?

                                     ROSE
                         Miss Rose Sayer.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         English?

                                     ROSE
                         Of course.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What are you doing on the lake?

                                     ALLNUT
                         I ain't told 'im nothin', Rosie.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         Silence!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Answer the question!

                                     ROSE
                         We were boating.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Last night? In such weather?

                                     ROSE
                         We were not responsible for the 
                         weather.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         And why were you boating?

                                     ROSE
                         That is our affair.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                         As your fellow-prisoner has already 
                         learned, the penalty for not answering 
                         the court is death.

                                     ROSE
                              (slow take)
                         You mean he --

               She gets it. She goes swiftly close to Allnutt.

                                     ROSE
                         Charlie! Are they telling me...

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (in German)
                         Order!

               The First Officer lays a restraining hand on her shoulder.

                                     ROSE
                              (wheeling in fury and 
                              slapping him hard 
                              across the face)
                         Stop that!

               He goes cold and smiles yellow.

                                     ROSE
                         Are they, Charlie? The truth?

               Allnutt looks back at her; his chin begins to tremble; with 
               heroic effort he masters it. He nods.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Fraulein Sayer, you will come to 
                         order and answer the questions of 
                         this court.

               Rose wheels and faces him; she is all cold fire.

                                     ROSE
                         Ask your questions.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         What were you doing on the lake?

                                     ROSE
                         We came here to sink this ship, and --

                                     ALLNUT
                              (in a loud voice)
                         Rosie!

                                     ROSE
                         -- and we would have, too, except 
                         for --

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie!

                                     ROSE
                         Let's at least have the fun of telling 
                         them about it, Charlie.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Don't you believe her, yer Honor. 
                         She's touched with the fever.

                                     ROSE
                              (impatient)
                         Oh stop it, Charlie, we've been 
                         through all this.
                              (primly)
                         I'm not going to outlive you and 
                         that's all there is to it.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (a bit amused and 
                              skeptical)
                         Just how, Fraulein, did you propose 
                         to sink -- the K?nigin Luise?

                                     ROSE
                         We were going to ram you.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         With how large a vessel?

                                     ROSE
                         With torpedoes.

                                     CAPTAIN AND 1ST OFFICER
                              (look at each other; 
                              in unison)
                         Torpedoes!

                                     2ND OFFICER
                         Torpedoes?

                                     CAPTAIN AND 1ST OFFICER
                              (in unison; tossing 
                              bones to a dog; in 
                              German)
                         Torpedoes.

                                     2ND OFFICER
                              (gaping)
                         Nein!
                              (foolish enough to 
                              believe Rose and 
                              Allnutt, he looks at 
                              them with awe)

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (interpreting, smooth 
                              and sardonic)
                         I think it is safe to assume, Miss 
                         Sayer, that the British Admiralty 
                         did not entrust you and this -- 
                         gentleman -- with the torpedoes. 
                         Will you be so good as to tell us 
                         precisely where and how you acquired 
                         them?

                                     ROSE
                         Acquired? Mr. Allnutt made them.

               First Officer and Captain exchange a significant glance: she 
               is obviously nuts. (All through this, the Second Officer, 
               who no spik English, is like a puzzled observer at a tennis 
               match.)

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (a little like a warden 
                              in a loony house)
                         How very interesting.

                                     ROSE
                         I don't think you even believe me. 
                         Tell him how you did it, Charlie.
                              (Over Allnutt's lines, 
                              the officers exchange 
                              glances which mean: 
                              "He's loony, too".)

                                     ALLNUT
                              (100% the engineer)
                         Well -- wot I did was take the 'eads 
                         off two cylinders of oxygen an' fill 
                         'em up with 'igh explosive -- 'bout 
                         two 'undred weight. That was easy 
                         enough -- it was the detonators took 
                         some hingenooity. Know wot I used? 
                         Cartridges, an' nails, in blocks o' 
                         soft wood. A pretty job. Then I 
                         mounted the cylinders so they stuck 
                         through the bows of The African Queen, 
                         near the water line, so when we rammed 
                         you --

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (half believing what 
                              he can't believe)
                         Where is The African Queen?

                                     ROSE
                         She sank in the storm.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         How did you get onto the lake?

                                     ROSE
                         We came down the Ulanga -- the Bora, 
                         you call it down here.

               All three officers look at each other -- even the Second 
               Officer catches this -- and back at Rose.

                                     CAPTAIN
                              (in English)

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (in English)

                                     2ND OFFICER
                              (in German)
                              (together)
                         But that is impossible!

                                     ROSE
                         Nevertheless!

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Everybody knows the river is 
                         unnavigable.

                                     ROSE
                              (proudly)
                         We came down it, though -- didn't 
                         we, Charlie? -- on The African Queen.

               CLOSE SHOT -- THE DERELICT AFRICAN QUEEN

               floating keel up. She is under water except for the two 
               cylinders which stick up like the antennae of a snail.

               CAMERA DOES LONG PULL BACK, to show The Louisa approaching.

               EXT. DECK -- THE LOUISA

               MEDIUM SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

               as they come out of the cabin surrounded by the ship's 
               officers. The company stops near the main mast where a crew 
               member has finished making a hangman's noose of one rope and 
               is now tying a knot in another.

                                     1ST OFFICER
                              (to Captain)
                         The man first.

                                     ROSE
                         Please -- hang us together.

                                     CAPTAIN
                         Very well.

               He nods to the First Officer to proceed with the execution. 
               Allnutt and Rose exchange a look of satisfaction.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Rosie, I ain't gonna say goodbye 
                         again. It's gettin' to be an old 
                         story.

                                     ROSE
                         Darling!

               The next moment, the deck heaves upward. There is a rush of 
               air and a frightful ROAR. Smoke and flying debris fill the 
               SCREEN.

               MEDIUM LONG SHOT -- THE WATER

               where those who were on deck are now struggling. There is 
               something ludicrous about the Germans in their ducks with 
               the gold buttons and decorations trying to keep above water.

               CLOSE SHOT -- ROSE AND ALLNUTT

                                     ALLNUT
                         Wot 'appened?

                                     ROSE
                         We did it, Charlie, we did it!

                                     ALLNUT
                         But 'ow?

               Rose points to a piece of wreckage floating on the water in 
               the near distance.

                                     ALLNUT
                         Well I'll be... Are you all right, 
                         Rosie?

                                     ROSE
                         Never better. And you, dear?

                                     ALLNUT
                         Bit of all right.

                                     ROSE
                         I'm all turned round, Charlie. Which 
                         way is the south shore?
